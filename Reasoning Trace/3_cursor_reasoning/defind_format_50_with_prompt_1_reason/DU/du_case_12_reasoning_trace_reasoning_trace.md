## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The system is running OAI 5G NR in SA mode over RF Simulator (rfsim). CU and DU are split via F1; UE connects to the rfsim server on localhost.
- Expected bring-up: process init → NGAP setup (CU↔AMF) → F1AP (CU↔DU) → DU PHY/MAC start → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB sync → PRACH (Msg1) → RRC setup → PDU session.
- The provided misconfiguration is explicit: prach_ConfigurationIndex=200 in DU `servingCellConfigCommon`. PRACH timing is tightly constrained by 3GPP TS 38.211 §6.3.3.2; some indices push PRACH occasions to invalid or last-slot-symbol boundaries for a given TDD pattern.
- High-level hypothesis (guided by misconfigured_param): PRACH config index 200 yields an invalid PRACH occasion placement for the configured numerology/TDD pattern, triggering an assertion during common-cell configuration fix-up in DU, causing DU to exit. Consequently, the UE fails to connect to the rfsim server (connection refused) and the CU waits for F1 without a DU.

Network configuration highlights:
- gNB/CU: `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` and NGU both 192.168.8.43. NGAP setup succeeds per CU logs. F1 uses 127.0.0.5 (CU) ↔ 127.0.0.3 (DU).
- DU:
  - `servingCellConfigCommon[0]`: FR1 n78, SCS=30 kHz (subcarrierSpacing=1), `dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity=6` with TDD slots/symbols (7 DL slots, 6 DL symbols; 2 UL slots, 4 UL symbols), `prach_ConfigurationIndex=200`, `prach_msg1_FDM=0`, `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=1`, `zeroCorrelationZoneConfig=13`.
  - rfsimulator: server mode on port 4043.
- UE: IMSI set; radio tuned to DL 3619200000 Hz (consistent with `absoluteFrequencySSB` 641280 → 3.6192 GHz). Attempts to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 fail repeatedly.

Initial mismatch noted: `prach_ConfigurationIndex=200` conflicts with the chosen TDD pattern/DMRS/SSB/SCS; DU asserts early, preventing RF server start.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA: NGAP initializes and registers with AMF.
  - "Send NGSetupRequest" → "Received NGSetupResponse" confirms CU↔AMF is healthy.
- GTP-U is configured on 192.168.8.43:2152, consistent with `NETWORK_INTERFACES`.
- F1AP at CU starts, SCTP setup toward DU (127.0.0.5 local, DU at 127.0.0.3 per config). No subsequent F1AP UE activity, which is expected if the DU exits.
- No anomalies on CU aside from waiting for DU; CU is not the fault origin here.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC and reads ServingCellConfigCommon. Key crash lines:
  - Assertion (prach_info.start_symbol + prach_info.N_t_slot * prach_info.N_dur < 14) failed!
  - In fix_scc() .../gnb_config.c:529
  - PRACH with configuration index 200 goes to the last symbol of the slot, for optimal performance pick another index. See Tables 6.3.3.2-2 to 6.3.3.2-4 in 38.211
  - Exiting execution
- Interpretation:
  - OAI computes PRACH occasion parameters (start symbol, duration) from `prach_ConfigurationIndex`, numerology (µ=1), PRACH format, FDM, and TDD pattern. Here, index 200 maps PRACH beyond the allowed symbol budget of a slot (14 symbols) or aligns at the last symbol → violates OAI guard/optimization check, hence assert.
  - The assert occurs during `fix_scc()` which validates and adjusts ServingCellConfigCommon before activating PHY. Therefore the DU never reaches operational state or starts the rfsim server.
- This directly implicates the misconfigured parameter as the root cause of the DU crash.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE radio configuration matches gNB (n78, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB_DL 106) and sets DL/UL to 3.6192 GHz.
- UE repeatedly attempts TCP connections to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 and gets ECONNREFUSED (errno 111).
- Since the DU crashed before starting the rfsim server listener, there is no server to accept the connection; hence repeated failures. No RF or synchronization issue on the UE—the network endpoint is simply absent.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - DU asserts early in ServingCellConfigCommon validation due to `prach_ConfigurationIndex=200` → process exits.
  - Without DU, rfsim server is not listening → UE connection attempts to 127.0.0.1:4043 fail repeatedly.
  - CU remains healthy with AMF but sees no DU via F1AP after initial socket create.
- 3GPP/OAI rationale:
  - Per 3GPP TS 38.211 §6.3.3.2 and tables 6.3.3.2-2..-4, PRACH occasions are indexed by `prach-ConfigurationIndex` and depend on numerology (µ), PRACH format (A1/A2/A3/C0, etc.), and frame structure (TDD pattern). Certain indices are only valid for specific combinations; others may place PRACH too late in a slot for the chosen configuration.
  - OAI enforces that PRACH duration plus start offset remain within a 14-symbol slot. Index 200 violates this under the configured SCS/TDD pattern (`dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity=6`, `nrofDownlinkSlots=7`, `nrofUplinkSlots=2`, etc.), leading to the assert.
- Root cause: Misconfigured `prach_ConfigurationIndex=200` in DU `servingCellConfigCommon` causes invalid PRACH timing placement for the selected numerology/TDD, triggering an assert and terminating DU.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Primary fix: Choose a PRACH configuration index compatible with µ=1 (30 kHz), FR1 n78, PRACH format and the defined TDD pattern so that PRACH start+duration < 14 symbols and falls into UL resources.
  - Empirically valid indices for OAI default TDD patterns and µ=1 include values commonly used in example configs, e.g., 16, 32, 84, 100 (actual choice depends on PRACH format/FDM/SSB alignment). Given OAI examples, using `prach_ConfigurationIndex=16` is a safe starting point.
- Keep the rest of PRACH parameters aligned:
  - `prach_msg1_FDM=0` (1 FD-RAO) is fine; if changing format, verify with spec tables.
  - `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=1` (30 kHz) matches UE/gNB µ.
  - `zeroCorrelationZoneConfig=13` can stay, but verify NCS compatibility if changing PRACH format.
- Validation steps:
  - After changing the index, ensure DU passes `fix_scc()` without asserts.
  - Confirm rfsim server starts; UE should connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, then observe PRACH Msg1/Msg2 in logs and RRC setup.
  - If PRACH miss or RA failures occur, iterate index choice using 38.211 tables or OAI doc/examples.

Further analysis suggestions:
- If PRACH success is intermittent, verify SSB to RACH mapping (`ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB`), `rsrp_ThresholdSSB`, and ensure RA window and timers (ra_ResponseWindow, t300/t301/t310) are appropriate.
- Cross-check PRACH format selection implicitly derived by OAI from index versus any explicit format constraints; align with 38.211 Tables 6.3.3.1-5/6.3.3.2-2..-4.
- Use OAI debug logs at PHY/MAC levels for PRACH scheduling visibility.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack precise timestamps; we infer order from message sequences.
- The exact PRACH format derived from index 200 is not printed; we rely on OAI’s assert and the cited 38.211 tables.
- We did not verify alternative indices against the full TDD pattern programmatically; recommendation follows common OAI defaults for µ=1. If issues persist, consult 38.211 tables to select an index guaranteeing `start_symbol + duration < 14` within UL symbols for the configured pattern.
