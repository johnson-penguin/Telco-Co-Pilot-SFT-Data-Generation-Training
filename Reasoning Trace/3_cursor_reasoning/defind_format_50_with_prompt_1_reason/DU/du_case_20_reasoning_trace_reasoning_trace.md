## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The system is an OAI 5G NR SA deployment using rfsim (software radio simulator). Logs show CU and DU starting, establishing F1-C, and DU running as the rfsim server. The UE attempts synchronization but repeatedly fails to detect SSB. Expected SA flow: component init → NGAP setup (CU↔AMF) → F1AP setup (CU↔DU) → DU L1 runs rfsim server → UE connects, detects SSB, performs PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session. Potential issues include misconfigured TDD UL/DL pattern, PRACH, SSB positions, or timing schedule causing “out-of-order Tx” and preventing UE sync.

From network_config:
- gNB/CU networking is consistent with logs: `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF = 192.168.8.43`, NGSetup succeeds.
- DU `servingCellConfigCommon[0]` shows TDD config with `dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity = 6`, `nrofDownlinkSlots = 15`, `nrofDownlinkSymbols = 6`, `nrofUplinkSlots = 2`, `nrofUplinkSymbols = 4`, numerology mu=1 (30 kHz SCS, 106 PRBs) per logs.
- Misconfigured parameter provided: `nrofDownlinkSlots=15`.

Initial mismatch observation guided by the misconfigured param:
- For mu=1, slots per 1 ms = 2, hence per 5 ms = 10 and per 10 ms = 20. In OAI, `dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity = 6` commonly maps to 5 ms. If so, `nrofDownlinkSlots = 15` exceeds the number of slots in the period, leading to an inconsistent TDD pattern and scheduler timeline errors. This aligns with the DU’s HW warning about out-of-order transmissions and the UE’s inability to sync.

Conclusion to test: invalid TDD slot allocation due to `nrofDownlinkSlots=15` causing DU L1 timing inconsistencies and breaking downlink SSB/SSS/PSS reception on UE.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode, NGAP threads, and GTPU initialization.
- NGSetupRequest/Response with AMF succeeds; CU logs: “Received NGSetupResponse from AMF” and “associated AMF 1”.
- F1AP starts; CU receives F1 Setup Request from DU and sends F1 Setup Response; cell PLMN 001/01 in service.
- No anomalies or stalls at CU. Networking parameters (AMF IP, GTPU) match network_config.

Interpretation: CU is healthy; any UE attach failure is likely not due to CU/AMF.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes F1AP, connects to CU (127.0.0.3 ↔ 127.0.0.5). MAC indicates F1 Setup Response received and RRC version aligns.
- PHY parameters: mu=1, N_RB=106, SCS=30 kHz, band readout 48 (from frequency 3619.2 MHz), consistent with `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280` (~3.6192 GHz). RU acts as rfsim server.
- Critical anomaly: “Not supported to send Tx out of order 28999680, 28999679”. This indicates the L1 scheduler generated transmit timestamps that regress by one sample, i.e., time goes backward—typical of an inconsistent frame/slot accounting.

Link to TDD config:
- With `dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity` ~5 ms and `nrofDownlinkSlots=15`, the requested DL slots exceed slots available in the period (10). Combined with `nrofUplinkSlots=2` plus DL/UL symbol tail portions, the sum overflows the period boundary. OAI’s scheduler may wrap incorrectly, producing non-monotonic timestamps and the out-of-order Tx error, preventing stable downlink and SSB transmission at consistent times.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE repeatedly performs initial synchronization and fails: “synch Failed” loops while scanning the expected center frequency (3619200000) with 106 PRBs.
- No rfsim connection errors are shown; rather, the UE cannot detect SSB.

Interpretation: The DU is running, but its DL timeline is inconsistent, so SSB symbols are not presented at predictable times; the UE’s correlators cannot lock, hence repeated sync failures.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU and F1 are fine; DU L1 starts as rfsim server; then out-of-order Tx warning appears; UE cannot sync thereafter.
- The misconfigured parameter `nrofDownlinkSlots=15` is incompatible with the likely 5 ms TDD periodicity at mu=1. This invalid TDD allocation yields a broken slot schedule and non-monotonic transmit timestamps at the DU, blocking SSB detection and initial access at the UE.
- Therefore, the root cause is an invalid TDD UL/DL configuration: `nrofDownlinkSlots` exceeds the number of available slots in the configured `dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity` for mu=1.

Standards and OAI alignment:
- Per 3GPP NR timing (TS 38.211/38.213), the TDD pattern must fit within the selected periodicity. For mu=1, there are 2 slots per ms; for a 5 ms periodicity, 10 slots total. OAI expects these parameters to define a consistent schedule; otherwise, timing and buffer scheduling may fail, causing out-of-order Tx.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Fix the DU’s TDD UL/DL configuration so the slot/symbol allocations fit into the periodicity. A commonly working OAI example for mu=1, 5 ms periodicity is:
- `nrofDownlinkSlots: 7`
- `nrofDownlinkSymbols: 6`
- `nrofUplinkSlots: 2`
- `nrofUplinkSymbols: 4`
This keeps the total within the 5 ms period and maintains a balanced DL/UL.

              "dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity": 6,
              "nrofDownlinkSlots": 7,          // was 15, exceeds 5 ms period at mu=1
              "nrofDownlinkSymbols": 6,

          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "cu_conf": { }
  }
}
```

Operational steps after config change:
- Restart DU first; verify DU logs no longer show “out-of-order Tx”.
- Observe UE: it should detect SSB, proceed to PRACH, RRC setup.
- If issues persist, validate:
  - Periodicity mapping: ensure `dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity` matches intended 5 ms in OAI build used.
  - SSB parameters: `ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap`, `ssb_periodicityServingCell` (2 often denotes 20 ms), and SSB power are reasonable.
  - PRACH settings: `prach_ConfigurationIndex`, root sequence, zeroCorrelationZone consistent with mu=1.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; we infer periodicity mapping (`dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity = 6 → 5 ms`) based on common OAI enumerations for mu=1. If the build maps differently, the general constraint still holds: total DL/UL slots+symbols must not exceed the period’s capacity.
- CU/UE configs are partial; however, the DU’s “out-of-order Tx” and the misconfigured `nrofDownlinkSlots` strongly indicate the TDD schedule overflow as the root cause.
- Band readout (48) versus configured (78) is deduced from frequency; both include 3.6 GHz ranges, unlikely to be the blocker here.
