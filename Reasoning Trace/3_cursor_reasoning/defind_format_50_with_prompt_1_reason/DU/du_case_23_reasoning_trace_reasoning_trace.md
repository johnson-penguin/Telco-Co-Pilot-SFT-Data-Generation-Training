## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsim. The CU initializes NGAP and GTPU, and prepares F1AP on 127.0.0.5. The DU should start MAC/RLC/L1, bind F1-C and GTP-U to its local addresses, then run the rfsim server so the UE can connect (client mode) to 127.0.0.1:4043. The UE logs show repeated TCP connect attempts to 127.0.0.1:4043 failing with errno(111), consistent with a DU that never came up as the rfsim server. The provided misconfigured parameter is `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=999.999.0.1` (an invalid IPv4). This field is used to bind DU networking (F1-C SCTP and GTP-U) and must be a valid, locally reachable IPv4.

From network_config (DU):
- `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address = 999.999.0.1` (invalid IP) and `remote_n_address = 127.0.0.5` (CU address). The DU log echoes: `F1-C DU IPaddr 999.999.0.1` and attempts to bind GTP to `999.999.0.1`.
- Radio parameters (freq 3619200000 Hz, mu=1, 106 PRBs) align with UE/CU; TDD pattern looks sensible (7 DL slots, 2 UL slots, 6 DL symbols, 4 UL symbols) and not the blocker here.

Conclusion to test: The DU fails during early network binding because the configured local IP is invalid; thus SCTP/GTP initialization aborts, F1AP DU task asserts, the DU exits, and UE cannot connect to the rfsim server.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA mode, sets up NGAP and GTPU on `192.168.8.43:2152`. It sends NGSetupRequest and receives NGSetupResponse from AMF. F1AP is started at CU, and a local GTPU instance for CU-side `127.0.0.5:2152` is created.
- No critical errors. CU appears healthy and ready for a DU F1 connection on 127.0.0.5.

Cross-reference with config:
- CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` matches logs (`GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/NGU = 192.168.8.43`). F1-C endpoint is prepared on 127.0.0.5 per `local_s_address`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU brings up NR PHY/MAC, reports TDD period (5 ms), slot allocations, and derives band/frequency consistent with config.
- Immediately upon F1/transport setup: `F1-C DU IPaddr 999.999.0.1, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 999.999.0.1`.
- Errors follow:
  - `getaddrinfo(999.999.0.1) failed: Name or service not known`
  - Assertion in `sctp_eNB_task.c:397` during association request handling
  - `can't create GTP-U instance`, then assertion in `f1ap_du_task.c:147` about F1-U GTP module
- The process exits; no rfsim server starts.

Interpretation: The invalid local IP causes both SCTP (F1-C) and UDP (GTP-U) binding failures. OAI asserts and exits the DU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY with DL freq 3619200000, mu=1, 106 PRBs. It runs as rfsim client and tries to connect repeatedly to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- All connection attempts fail with errno(111) (connection refused), consistent with no server listening—because DU exited before starting rfsim.

Interpretation: UE failures are a downstream consequence of DU’s early termination due to invalid DU local IP.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU is healthy and waiting.
- DU config sets `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address` to `999.999.0.1`, which is not a valid IPv4 address. Logs show both SCTP and GTP cannot bind/resolve it, leading to asserts and DU exit.
- UE cannot connect to rfsim server (errno 111) because DU never started the server after crashing.

Root cause: Misconfigured DU local transport IP (`MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=999.999.0.1`).

Why this field matters in OAI:
- `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address` is used by the DU to bind F1-C SCTP and GTP-U sockets and to advertise the DU’s address to the CU. It must be a valid, locally assigned IPv4 address that matches routing/interface configuration (commonly `127.0.0.3` in rfsim setups, with CU at `127.0.0.5`).

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Set `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address` to a valid local IP consistent with the CU’s `remote_s_address` and the typical rfsim loopback mapping. In OAI examples, DU often uses `127.0.0.3` and CU uses `127.0.0.5`.

        "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3"     // matches DU local_n_address
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after change:
- Start DU; confirm no `getaddrinfo` or SCTP/GTP asserts. Verify F1-C SCTP connects to CU and DU logs “F1 Setup Response received”.
- Confirm DU rfsim server starts; UE should connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 successfully. Then expect SSB detection, PRACH, and RRC procedures to proceed.
- If still failing:
  - Ensure loopback addresses are allowed and not blocked by local firewall.
  - Verify that only one DU instance binds to 127.0.0.3:2152/500.
  - Confirm CU `remote_s_address` matches DU `local_n_address`.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated but contain decisive transport-layer errors tied directly to the invalid IP.
- We assume standard rfsim topology using loopback addresses; in custom topologies, choose a valid interface IP and align CU/DU remote/local addresses accordingly.
- Other RF/PHY settings appear coherent and are unlikely to be the blocker once transport binding is corrected.
