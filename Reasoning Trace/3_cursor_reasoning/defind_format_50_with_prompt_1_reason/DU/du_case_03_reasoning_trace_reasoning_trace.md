## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The system is running OAI 5G NR in SA mode with `rfsim` based on CU/DU/UE logs showing SA initialization and the UE attempting to connect to an RF simulator at `127.0.0.1:4043`. The expected sequence: process config → initialize PHY/MAC/RRC → CU establishes NGAP with AMF → CU/DU F1AP → DU starts RF simulator server → UE connects to RF simulator → PRACH/RACH → RRC connection and PDU session setup.

From network_config:
- CU `plmn_list`: `mcc=1`, `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2` (i.e., PLMN 001/01).
- DU `plmn_list[0]`: missing `mcc` entirely; only `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2` provided.
- UE `imsi=001010000000001` → MCC 001, MNC 01, matching CU’s PLMN and intended DU PLMN.

Misconfigured parameter: **`plmn_list[0].mcc=001A`**. This is invalid (non-numeric) for MCC. OAI config checker interprets/validates MCC as an integer in range [0, 999]. In the DU logs we see the validator firing: `config_check_intrange: mcc: 1000 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999`, followed by `config_execcheck ... Exiting OAI softmodem`. So DU exits early during config, preventing the RF simulator server from starting.

Initial mismatch summary:
- DU MCC invalid/missing per config; CU and UE use MCC=001, MNC=01.
- Because DU aborts, UE’s repeated connection failures to the RF simulator (errno 111) are secondary effects.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU initializes in SA, registers with AMF, sends/receives NGSetup, starts GTP-U and F1AP, sets up SCTP for F1-C to `127.0.0.5`, and configures NGU `192.168.8.43:2152`. This indicates CU is healthy and connected to AMF:
  - `Send NGSetupRequest to AMF` → `Received NGSetupResponse from AMF`.
  - `Starting F1AP at CU` and creating F1 SCTP socket.
- No anomalies on CU side related to PLMN; PLMN is used in NGSetup and cell broadcast encoding later, but CU proceeds fine. Thus CU is not the failure point.

Cross-reference with config:
- `NETWORK_INTERFACES` and AMF IP/ports in CU logs match `network_config.cu_conf` (NGU 192.168.8.43:2152).

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC, parses serving cell config (Band n78, 106 PRBs, SSB at 641280), sets TDD pattern. Frequencies and numerology align with UE.
- Critical failure during config validation:
  - `config_check_intrange: mcc: 1000 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999`
  - `config_execcheck ... 1 parameters with wrong value`
  - `Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`
- This occurs while reading `GNBSParams` and before the RF simulator server would be brought up. Therefore DU terminates, never serving RF simulator.

Link to `network_config.du_conf`:
- `plmn_list[0]` lacks `mcc`. Given the misconfigured_param `mcc=001A`, the test case likely injected a non-numeric MCC in the DU `.conf`. OAI’s parser either read a malformed field or a default/overflow resulting in `1000`, tripping the integer range guard (valid MCC range is 0–999).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for DL/UL 3619.2 MHz, μ=1, N_RB=106, matching DU’s intended config.
- Repeated errors: `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)` (connection refused). This is consistent with the DU having exited before the RF simulator server starts.
- No RACH/RRC attempts are logged; the UE cannot proceed without RF sim connection.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - DU aborts during config due to invalid MCC (`mcc=001A` → invalid integer; validator shows `1000` out of range), so RF simulator server never starts.
  - UE cannot connect to RF simulator (`errno 111`), so no PRACH/RRC occurs.
  - CU is fine with AMF and starts F1, but with no DU available, the system cannot proceed to serve UE.
- Root cause: **Invalid DU PLMN MCC value (`plmn_list[0].mcc=001A`) violating OAI config validation (must be integer 0–999).** Correct value must match UE/CU PLMN: MCC 001.

Standards and OAI rationale:
- MCC/MNC are decimal digit codes (3 digits for MCC) per 3GPP; non-digit characters are invalid. OAI enforces integer range checks for MCC; `001A` fails numeric parsing and manifests as out-of-range during validation.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration changes:
- Set DU `plmn_list[0].mcc` to decimal 1 (interpreted as MCC 001), aligning with CU and UE. Ensure `mnc=1` with `mnc_length=2` denotes MNC 01.
- Review the DU `.conf` generator to prevent alphanumeric MCC inputs.

    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after fix:
- Start DU and confirm absence of `config_execcheck` errors.
- Verify DU starts RF simulator server; UE connects successfully (no errno 111).
- Observe PRACH activity in DU logs and RRC connection establishment in CU/UE logs.

Further debugging if issues persist:
- Ensure CU/DU F1 endpoints match (`127.0.0.5` CU, `127.0.0.3` DU) and firewall permits local SCTP/UDP ports.
- Confirm serving cell frequencies and TDD pattern match between DU and UE (they already do).

## 7. Limitations
- The provided DU config JSON omits the explicit bad value `001A`; the DU logs, however, clearly show the validator rejecting MCC as out-of-range, consistent with the misconfigured parameter description. Detailed DU `.conf` content is not shown, but the failure is conclusive from logs.
- Timestamps are not provided, but the sequence is unambiguous: DU configuration error precedes UE connection attempts.

Conclusion: Fix DU `plmn_list[0].mcc` to a valid integer (1 → MCC 001) to pass OAI config validation, allow DU startup, enable RF simulator server, and unblock UE attachment.
