## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The system is running OAI 5G NR in SA mode with RF Simulator. CU logs show successful NGAP setup with the AMF and CU-side F1AP initialization. DU logs indicate full init of PHY/MAC until a configuration validation error occurs, then a controlled exit. UE runs as RFSim client and repeatedly fails to connect to the RFSim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, consistent with the DU not coming up to host the server. The provided network configuration shows a mismatch in `du_conf.gNBs[0].plmn_list[0].mnc_length`, which the logs explicitly flag as invalid.

Key extracted parameters:
- From `cu_conf.gNBs.plmn_list`: mcc=1, mnc=1, mnc_length=2
- From `du_conf.gNBs[0].plmn_list[0]`: mcc=1, mnc=1, mnc_length=5 (misconfigured)
- From `ue_conf.uicc0.imsi`: 001010000000001 → MCC=001, MNC=01 (length 2), DNN oai, SST 1

Immediate mismatch: DU uses `mnc_length=5` which is not allowed; CU uses `mnc_length=2`, consistent with UE IMSI (MNC=01).

Expected flow (SA, RFSim):
1) CU boots, connects to AMF (NGAP), starts F1AP listener to DU.
2) DU boots, validates config, starts RFSim server, establishes F1AP with CU.
3) UE boots, connects to RFSim server, syncs SSB, performs PRACH, receives SIB1/ra-setup, RRC setup, PDU session.
Disruption point: DU exits during config validation due to invalid `mnc_length`, preventing RFSim server and F1AP establishment; UE can’t connect; CU waits.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode, initializes NGAP and GTP-U, sends NGSetupRequest, receives NGSetupResponse (AMF OK).
- Starts F1AP at CU and opens SCTP toward DU (`F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ ... 127.0.0.5`).
- No errors in CU; it’s waiting for DU to connect over F1.
- CU network settings match provided `NETWORK_INTERFACES` and AMF IP; no anomaly tied to PLMN at CU.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC, TDD config, carrier frequencies/bandwidths, SIB1 TDA, antenna ports.
- Critical line:
  - `[CONFIG] config_check_intval: mnc_length: 5 invalid value, authorized values: 2 3`
  - Followed by: `config_execcheck ... 1 parameters with wrong value` and an immediate exit via `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- This shows DU’s configuration validator rejecting `plmn_list[0].mnc_length=5`. OAI accepts only 2 or 3 for NR PLMN MNC length.
- Because the DU exits, it never starts the RFSim server nor completes F1AP with CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY threads and attempts to connect to RFSim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Repeated `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` indicates no server listening — expected since DU exited early.
- UE RF and numerology match the DU’s intended config (band/numerology), so the failure is transport-level (no RFSim server), not RF/mismatched parameters on-air.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - DU exits immediately on config validation error → no RFSim server.
  - UE repeatedly fails to connect to RFSim server (connection refused).
  - CU remains operational with AMF but F1AP cannot complete because DU is down.
- Root cause is explicitly guided by the misconfigured parameter: `plmn_list[0].mnc_length=5` in DU configuration, which violates OAI constraints (allowed: 2 or 3). The CU uses `mnc_length=2` and the UE IMSI (001010...) implies MNC length 2 (MNC=01), so the correct value is 2 to maintain consistency across CU/DU/UE.
- Therefore, the DU’s invalid `mnc_length` prevents startup and cascades into CU waiting and UE connection refusals.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Actionable fixes:
- Set DU `plmn_list[0].mnc_length` to 2 (to match CU and UE IMSI encoding). Alternatively, 3 is also valid but would then require consistent changes to CU and UE IMSI mapping.
- Re-run DU; confirm RFSim server starts and F1AP connects. Then UE should connect to RFSim and proceed to SSB sync, PRACH, RRC setup.

Optional validations after fix:
- Confirm DU log no longer shows `config_check_intval` error for `mnc_length`.
- Observe RFSim server listening and UE successful TCP connect.
- Verify CU-F1AP association and RRC/NAS procedures.

      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you elect to use `mnc_length=3`, then align all components:
- Set CU `mnc_length` to 3 and represent UE MNC accordingly (e.g., IMSI with MNC=001), ensuring subscriber data at core matches.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated to initialization phases; exact F1AP failure on CU after DU exit isn’t shown but is implied.
- JSON excerpts focus on PLMN fields; other parameters appear consistent and not causal in this case.
- The acceptance of only 2 or 3 for `mnc_length` is corroborated directly in the DU logs; external spec lookup is not required.
