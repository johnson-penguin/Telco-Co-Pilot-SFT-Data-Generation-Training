## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OpenAirInterface 5G NR Standalone with RF simulator (rfsim). Logs show both CU and DU launched with `--sa` and `--rfsim`, and the UE acts as rfsim client repeatedly trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

- CU reaches NGAP setup with AMF and starts F1AP towards the DU (`127.0.0.5`).
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC, parses `ServingCellConfigCommon`, then aborts with an assertion during PUCCH common config ASN.1 encoding.
- UE initializes PHY for band n78, then repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` (connection refused), indicating the gNB DU rfsim server is not up.

Network config (excerpts):
- gNB/DU `servingCellConfigCommon[0]` has `hoppingId: 2048` and `pucchGroupHopping: 0` (neither/semi-static), PRACH index 98, FR1 n78, 106 PRBs, μ=1.
- UE UICC, basic SA settings; rfsim client implied by logs.

Guidance from misconfigured_param: `hoppingId=2048`. In NR RRC, `hoppingId` is carried in PUSCH/PUCCH config common and is a 10-bit integer, valid range 0..1023. Value 2048 violates spec and will cause RRC ASN.1 encoding/validation failures.

Immediate initial mismatch: DU uses `hoppingId=2048` (invalid). This aligns with the DU crash point in PUCCH common encoding.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode, initializes NGAP/GTPU/RRC threads, registers with AMF, and successfully exchanges NGSetupRequest/Response. It then starts F1AP and creates the F1 SCTP socket towards `127.0.0.5`.
- No subsequent evidence of successful F1AP association establishment with the DU appears, suggesting the DU is not alive long enough to complete F1 setup.
- CU networking (AMF/NGU `192.168.8.43`) matches logs; no CU-side faults detected.

Conclusion: CU is ready; it awaits DU for F1. Any stall is secondary to DU failure.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes NR PHY/MAC/RRC, parses ServingCellConfigCommon: `PhysCellId 0`, `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280` (3.6192 GHz), TDD config, 106 PRBs, μ=1.
- Immediately after SIB1 and TDD configuration prints, DU aborts with:
  - `Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed!`
  - `In clone_pucch_configcommon() ... nr_rrc_config.c:183`
  - `could not clone NR_PUCCH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding`
- This is an RRC ASN.1 encoding error while building PUCCH-ConfigCommon for SIB/ServingCellConfigCommon. The likely offending field is `hoppingId`, which must be within 0..1023 per 3GPP.

Conclusion: DU process exits during RRC configuration due to invalid `hoppingId` value, preventing RU/rfsim server startup and F1AP establishment.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes FR1/n78 with 106 PRBs, μ=1; starts threads and rfsim client.
- Repeatedly fails to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- This is consistent with the DU having crashed before binding the rfsim server socket; hence no server is listening.

Conclusion: UE cannot attach because the DU is down; the symptom is a downstream effect of the DU configuration error.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: DU initializes → RRC tries to encode PUCCH-ConfigCommon → ASN.1 encoding assertion → DU exits.
- CU had already performed NGAP with AMF and started F1AP, but the DU is not available to complete F1 association.
- UE, acting as rfsim client, cannot connect because the rfsim server (DU) never started due to the early crash.

Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): `hoppingId=2048` in DU `servingCellConfigCommon` violates the 3GPP range 0..1023 (10-bit). In OAI, RRC encodes this in PUCCH-ConfigCommon/PUSCH-ConfigCommon; out-of-range values trigger encoding failures (assert in `clone_pucch_configcommon`). This directly causes the DU to terminate before bringing up RF simulator and F1AP.

Standards/context:
- 3GPP TS 38.211/38.213 define sequence/group hopping behavior using `hoppingId` as a 10-bit value.
- 3GPP TS 38.331 RRC `PUCCH-ConfigCommon`/`PUSCH-ConfigCommon` constrain `hoppingId` to INTEGER (0..1023). Value 2048 is invalid.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Fix:
- Set `hoppingId` to a valid integer in [0, 1023]. Any value is acceptable as long as consistent across gNB common configs; choose, e.g., 512.
- Rebuild or restart the DU; verify that the rfsim server starts (listening on 4043), F1AP establishes, UE connects, PRACH proceeds, and RRC completes.

Corrected configuration snippets (JSON within network_config structure):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "gNB_ID": "0xe00",
        "gNB_DU_ID": "0xe00",
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-DU",
        "servingCellConfigCommon": [
          {
            "hoppingId": 512
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Optional validation and checks:
- After change, confirm DU log no longer shows `clone_pucch_configcommon` assertion; observe successful SIB1 encoding and cell setup.
- Ensure `rfsimulator.serveraddr` is configured appropriately (server mode for DU; UE should connect to the DU’s IP/port). The current UE attempts `127.0.0.1:4043`; keep this if all components run on the same host.
- If additional RRC encoding errors appear, verify adjacent fields: `pucchGroupHopping`, `p0_nominal`, numerologies, and PRACH consistency.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and not timestamped; sequencing relies on typical OAI bring-up order and printed messages.
- Only one explicit DU assertion is shown; while `hoppingId` is the clear misconfiguration, other latent issues cannot be excluded without full configs and end-to-end traces.
- Spec references are summarized from 3GPP TS 38.331 and TS 38.211 constraints on `hoppingId` (INTEGER 0..1023).
