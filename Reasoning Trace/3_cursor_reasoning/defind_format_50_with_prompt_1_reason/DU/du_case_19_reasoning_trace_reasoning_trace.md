## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs show OAI running in SA mode with RF simulator: DU and UE indicate rfsim usage; UE repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, suggesting the DU RF simulator server is not up due to a DU-side failure.
- Expected call flow in SA+rfsim: initialize CU/DU → F1AP up → DU PHY/MAC configured → RF simulator server listening → UE connects → PRACH (Msg1) → SIB1 decode → RRC connection → NAS registration → PDU session.
- The DU crashes during early PHY/common checks with an assertion in `check_ssb_raster()` followed by: "Couldn't find band 78 with SCS 4". This stops the RF simulator server, hence the UE’s repeated connection failures.
- Guided by the provided misconfiguration: misconfigured_param = "subcarrierSpacing=4".
  - In OAI JSON, `servingCellConfigCommon[0].subcarrierSpacing = 4` and several related fields (e.g., `dl_subcarrierSpacing`, `ul_subcarrierSpacing`, `initialDLBWPsubcarrierSpacing`, `initialULBWPsubcarrierSpacing`) are also set to 4.
  - OAI uses enumerated values: 0→15 kHz, 1→30 kHz, 2→60 kHz, 3→120 kHz, 4→240 kHz. Band n78 (FR1) supports SCS up to 60 kHz for SSB and carriers; 240 kHz is FR2 and invalid for band 78. Hence the raster check assert.
- Network configuration parsing (key items):
  - CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` match CU logs (AMF/NGU IP 192.168.8.43; NGSetup succeeds), so CU proceeds correctly.
  - DU `servingCellConfigCommon[0]`:
    - `dl_frequencyBand=78`, `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280` → 3619200000 Hz (as DU and UE logs print), `dl_carrierBandwidth=106` → 100 MHz channel.
    - Multiple `*_subcarrierSpacing=4` (i.e., 240 kHz) → incompatible with band 78 FR1. Also `referenceSubcarrierSpacing=1` hints intended 30 kHz, but `subcarrierSpacing=4` overrides and breaks consistency.
  - UE log prints "SSB numerology 1" (=30 kHz), consistent with FR1 band 78. So UE expects 30 kHz, but DU config forces 240 kHz, causing DU abort.

Conclusion: The DU configuration’s `subcarrierSpacing=4` (and aligned SCS fields) is invalid for n78 and triggers an early assert; this cascades to UE connection failures and CU waiting for DU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU starts in SA mode; threads for NGAP, RRC, GTPU, and F1 are created.
- NGAP: sends NGSetupRequest and receives NGSetupResponse → AMF connectivity is OK.
- GTPU: configured for IPv4 192.168.8.43:2152 (matches CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES`).
- F1AP: "Starting F1AP at CU", SCTP request to `127.0.0.5` shows internal F1 endpoints are set. No fatal errors; CU appears healthy but will wait for DU association.
- No anomalies besides the absence of F1 setup completion, which is expected since DU crashes.

Cross-ref: CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` match the log. Nothing CU-side blocks operation.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/L1/MAC, prints key radio parameters, decodes `ServingCellConfigCommon`: `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz` (band 78 center/raster okay), 100 MHz bandwidth (106 PRBs at 30 kHz numerology), TDD parameters present.
- Immediate fatal assert:
  - "Assertion (start_gscn != 0) failed! In check_ssb_raster() ... Couldn't find band 78 with SCS 4"
  - This indicates the SSB raster computation cannot locate a valid raster for the provided SCS value. In FR1 band 78, SSB SCS must be 15 or 30 kHz (some deployments allow 60 kHz for data BWPs, but not 240 kHz; 240 kHz is FR2 only). Hence the assert and process exit.
- Command line shows the DU is launched with the misconfigured conf. After assert, softmodem exits → the RF simulator server never starts, F1 does not come up.

Link to config: `servingCellConfigCommon[0].subcarrierSpacing = 4` is the prime culprit; the DU also sets `dl_subcarrierSpacing`, `ul_subcarrierSpacing`, `initialDLBWPsubcarrierSpacing`, `initialULBWPsubcarrierSpacing` to 4, compounding the mismatch.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes for DL freq 3619200000 Hz, SSB numerology 1 (30 kHz), N_RB_DL 106 → consistent FR1/n78 setup.
- UE attempts to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 and repeatedly gets `errno(111)` (connection refused). This is a direct consequence of the DU crash: the server side is not listening.
- No radio or RRC errors appear because the UE never reaches RF link establishment.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - DU crashes immediately due to invalid SCS for band 78.
  - Because DU aborts, rfsim server is down → UE connection attempts fail with `errno(111)`.
  - CU remains operational, NGAP up with AMF, but F1AP cannot complete since DU is absent.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): `subcarrierSpacing=4` (240 kHz) set in DU `servingCellConfigCommon` is invalid for FR1 band 78 and violates SSB raster constraints, causing `check_ssb_raster()` assert.
- Supporting details from the logs:
  - Explicit message: "Couldn't find band 78 with SCS 4".
  - UE expects SSB numerology 1 (30 kHz), confirming intended FR1 operation.

Note on standards mapping used for reasoning:
- In OAI and 3GPP, SCS enumerations typically map as: 0→15 kHz, 1→30 kHz, 2→60 kHz, 3→120 kHz, 4→240 kHz.
- FR1 (band n78) supports SSB at 15 or 30 kHz; 240 kHz SSB belongs to FR2 bands. Therefore, SCS=4 is invalid here.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Primary fix (align DU to FR1 band 78):
- Change all FR1-relevant SCS fields from 4 (240 kHz) to 1 (30 kHz). This includes at least:
  - `servingCellConfigCommon[0].subcarrierSpacing`
  - `dl_subcarrierSpacing`
  - `ul_subcarrierSpacing`
  - `initialDLBWPsubcarrierSpacing`
  - `initialULBWPsubcarrierSpacing`
  - Ensure `referenceSubcarrierSpacing` remains 1 (already 1), consistent with 30 kHz.

Optional validations after change:
- Ensure `absoluteFrequencySSB` and `dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA` correspond to valid NR-ARFCN raster for 30 kHz SSB in band 78 (the current values look consistent with logs).
- Verify PRACH parameters (e.g., `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98`, `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=1`) remain consistent with 30 kHz.
- After fix, confirm: DU boots without assert, rfsim server listens on 4043, UE successfully connects, decodes SIB1, performs RA, and RRC setup proceeds.

Corrected snippets within `network_config` (JSON-style with inline comments explaining changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "servingCellConfigCommon": [
          {
            "dl_subcarrierSpacing": 1,                // was 4; FR1 band n78 uses 30 kHz
            "ul_subcarrierSpacing": 1,                // was 4; align UL to 30 kHz
            "initialDLBWPsubcarrierSpacing": 1,       // was 4; 30 kHz initial DL BWP
            "initialULBWPsubcarrierSpacing": 1,       // was 4; 30 kHz initial UL BWP
            "subcarrierSpacing": 1,                   // was 4; SSB numerology → 30 kHz
            "referenceSubcarrierSpacing": 1           // already 1; keep as 30 kHz reference
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

No change is needed to `cu_conf` for this issue. The `ue_conf` is implicitly consistent with 30 kHz (UE log prints SSB numerology 1). If your UE JSON explicitly carries a frequency or numerology field elsewhere, ensure it remains 30 kHz to match DU.

Further analysis steps if issues persist after the above fix:
- If DU still asserts, re-check the full SCS coherence: SIB1 numerology, PDCCH CORESET0 (`controlResourceSetZero`), and search space zero configurations are band/numerology dependent.
- Use OAI’s NR-ARFCN conversion tools to validate `absoluteFrequencySSB` and `dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA` against the selected SCS.
- Increase `Asn1_verbosity` and PHY logs to `debug` to inspect SSB raster selection.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack precise timestamps, but the explicit raster error is sufficient to establish causality.
- We relied on standard SCS-to-enum mapping and typical FR1 band n78 constraints; implementation specifics could change across OAI versions, but the error string directly confirms the incompatibility.
- Only the DU JSON was provided for radio parameters; if other files override these values at runtime, ensure consistency across all configs.
