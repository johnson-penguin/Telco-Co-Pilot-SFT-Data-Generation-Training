## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- **Scenario**: OAI 5G NR Standalone (SA) with RF Simulator. CU runs NGAP/GTP-U and F1-C, DU runs PHY/MAC/RRC and RF simulator server, UE is RF simulator client.
- **Expected flow**: Startup → CU connects to AMF (NGAP) → CU starts F1AP server → DU starts and connects over F1 → DU builds SIB/serving cell config → RFsim server opens → UE connects to RFsim → UE detects SSB → PRACH/RA → RRC connection setup → PDU session.
- **Given misconfiguration**: `nr_cellid = -1` (from error case). In NR, the NR Cell Identifier (NCI) is 36 bits; valid range is [0, 2^36 − 1]. Using -1 underflows to 2^64 − 1 in unsigned contexts, exceeding 36-bit constraint.
- **Network config (parsed)**:
  - CU `gNB_ID=0xe00`, `nr_cellid=1`, NG interfaces on `192.168.8.43`, F1 local `127.0.0.5` → remote `127.0.0.3`.
  - DU servingCellConfigCommon: `physCellId=0`, FR1 n78, SCS µ=1, N_RB=106, PRACH index 98, TDD pattern DL-heavy. No explicit `nr_cellid` shown in extracted DU JSON; error case states it was set to -1 in the DU conf file.
  - UE config minimal (IMSI/DNN). RFsim client target `127.0.0.1:4043` from logs.

Initial mismatch: CU has valid `nr_cellid=1`, DU (in the error case) has `nr_cellid=-1`, which would break RRC SIB1 construction that uses NCI.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU confirms SA mode, initializes NGAP and GTP-U, registers to AMF, and receives NGSetupResponse: CU side is healthy.
- CU starts F1AP and opens SCTP on `127.0.0.5`; GTP-U also bound on loopback for CU-UP.
- No crashes or asserts. CU awaits DU over F1.
- Cross-check with config: NGU/NGAMF addresses `192.168.8.43` match logs. F1 local address `127.0.0.5` matches. Nothing abnormal at CU.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC; FR1 n78, µ=1, N_RB=106; TDD periodicity derived and printed; parameters align with servingCellConfigCommon.
- Critical failure:
  - `Assertion (cellID < (1l << 36)) failed!` in `get_SIB1_NR()` (nr_rrc_config.c:2493)
  - Message: `cellID must fit within 36 bits, but is 18446744073709551615` (which is 2^64 − 1, typical for casting -1 to unsigned).
  - DU then exits; repeated reads of GNBSParams show early abort during RRC SIB1 build.
- Mapping to config: This assert is triggered when constructing SIB1 where NCI is encoded. With `nr_cellid=-1` in DU config, the computed `cellID` violates the 36-bit constraint, causing abort.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes, configures RF chains, and then repeatedly tries to connect to RFsim server `127.0.0.1:4043`, failing with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- This is consistent with DU crash before RFsim server socket is opened; hence UE cannot connect.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU healthy and waiting for DU (F1 starts).
  - DU fails during SIB1 creation due to invalid `cellID` range → process exits → RFsim server never bound on 4043.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim server → repeated `connect()` failures.
- Root cause: DU `nr_cellid=-1` causes underflow to `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`, violating the SIB1 constraint `cellID < 2^36`. The OAI RRC function `get_SIB1_NR()` asserts on this invariant and exits.
- Spec rationale: 3GPP NR uses a 36-bit NR Cell Identity (NCI) and a 9- or 10-bit Physical Cell ID (PCI up to 1007). The OAI stack expects `nr_cellid` to be within [0, 2^36 − 1]; negative values are invalid.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix: Set DU `nr_cellid` to a valid non-negative value within 36 bits and ensure consistency with CU if required by your deployment (common practice is to use consistent NCI across CU/DU partition for the same cell).
- Suggested values:
  - DU `nr_cellid`: 1 (to match CU’s 1) or another valid value unique in your network.
  - Keep `servingCellConfigCommon.physCellId=0` if intended; PCI and NCI are distinct identifiers.
- After fix, re-run DU first; verify RFsim server listens on 4043; then start UE and confirm successful connection and SSB detection.
- Optional hardening: Add validation in your config generation to reject negative `nr_cellid` values before launching.

Corrected snippets (within your existing structures):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "nr_cellid": 1 // unchanged; valid 36-bit value
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          // Add or correct nr_cellid here; it was -1 in the error case
          "nr_cellid": 1, // FIX: valid 36-bit NCI; aligns with CU
          "servingCellConfigCommon": [
            {
              "physCellId": 0 // PCI stays as configured; independent from NCI
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Post-fix validation checklist:
- DU boots without assertion in `get_SIB1_NR()`; SIB1 assembled and broadcast parameters logged.
- RFsim server bound on `127.0.0.1:4043`; UE connects successfully.
- UE detects SSB at 3619.2 MHz, performs PRACH (with PRACH index 98), receives RAR, and proceeds to RRC Setup.

## 7. Limitations

- The provided extracted DU JSON did not explicitly include `nr_cellid`; the misconfigured parameter comes from the failing DU conf in the error run. Diagnosis is anchored on the assert and the stated misconfiguration.
- Logs are partial and without explicit timestamps; ordering is inferred by typical OAI startup sequences.
- The JSON snippets include comments for clarity and are illustrative; ensure your actual config syntax supports or omit comments accordingly.
