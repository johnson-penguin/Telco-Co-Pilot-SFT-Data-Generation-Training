## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR Standalone using RF simulator (rfsim): logs show both CU/DU/UE started with "--rfsim --sa". Expected bring-up: DU PHY/MAC init → SIB generation → DU exposes rfsim server → CU connects via F1AP → UE connects to rfsim server → UE searches SSB → PRACH → RRC attach and NGAP path on CU.

Key configs parsed from network_config:
- gNB/CU: `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43`, F1 CU address `127.0.0.5` (matches logs). NG setup succeeds.
- DU: FR1 n78, SCS µ=1 (30 kHz), `N_RB=106`, `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280` (3.6192 GHz). TDD pattern configured. RFsim server: `serverport=4043`, `serveraddr="server"` (DU acts as server).
- UE: IMSI etc.; RF and numerology match DU.

Misconfigured parameter provided: `ssb_periodicityServingCell=9` in DU `servingCellConfigCommon`.
Initial mismatch signals from logs: DU asserts during SIB encoding with message "ASN1 message encoding failed (ssb-PeriodicityServingCell, 18446744073709551615)" which correlates strongly with an invalid SSB periodicity value.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU runs SA, initializes NGAP and GTP-U, sends NGSetupRequest and receives NGSetupResponse from AMF: control plane to AMF is healthy.
- F1AP starts and opens SCTP towards DU at `127.0.0.5` ↔ `127.0.0.3` as configured.
- No fatal errors; CU is waiting for DU to come up and complete F1AP association and subsequent procedures.
- Config parameters (NG IPs/ports) align with `cu_conf` and log entries.

Conclusion: CU is fine; it’s not the root cause.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC, TDD pattern, carrier and SSB frequency, SIB1 TDA, etc. All consistent with `du_conf`.
- Critical failure:
  - Assertion in `encode_SIB_NR()` at `openair2/RRC/NR/nr_rrc_config.c:2803`.
  - Message: "ASN1 message encoding failed (ssb-PeriodicityServingCell, 18446744073709551615)!" then exit.
- This occurs during RRC SIB encoding, before DU can fully start and expose functional RFsim server.
- Mapping to config: `servingCellConfigCommon[0].ssb_periodicityServingCell = 9` (from `network_config`). In 3GPP TS 38.331, `ssb-PeriodicityServingCell` is an enumerated type with allowed values {ms5, ms10, ms20, ms40, ms80, ms160}. OAI expects one of those, typically expressed as 5/10/20/40/80/160 in config or mapped enumerations. Value `9` is invalid, leading to encoder failure and the printed sentinel (all-ones `uint64_t`).

Conclusion: DU crashes due to invalid `ssb_periodicityServingCell` → SIB encoding cannot proceed.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with parameters matching DU (µ=1, N_RB=106, DL=UL=3.6192 GHz).
- UE acts as rfsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` but gets `errno(111)` (connection refused) in a loop.
- In rfsim, the DU is the server. Because DU exits on SIB encoding assert, the rfsim server socket is not available, hence UE cannot connect.

Conclusion: UE failures are a consequence of DU crash; not a UE-side misconfiguration.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - DU hits SIB ASN.1 encoding error on `ssb-PeriodicityServingCell` and exits.
  - CU remains up but cannot complete DU association/data plane.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server (`127.0.0.1:4043`) because DU crashed; repeated `errno(111)` confirms no listener.
- Root cause guided by provided `misconfigured_param`:
  - `ssb_periodicityServingCell=9` is outside allowed set per 38.331 and OAI’s RRC encoding. Encoder reports failure exactly at that IE, confirming causality.

No additional spec lookup needed; the logs are explicit and match known constraints: valid periodicities are 5/10/20/40/80/160 ms.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix: Set `ssb_periodicityServingCell` to a valid value; default and commonly used is 10 ms.
- After change, expected behavior:
  - DU successfully encodes SIB, continues startup, exposes rfsim server on 4043.
  - UE connects to rfsim server, performs SSB detection and initial access (PRACH), RRC attach follows.
  - CU completes F1AP association with DU, NGAP path proceeds as usual.

Corrected snippets (only fields relevant to the fix shown):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "servingCellConfigCommon": [
            {
              "ssb_periodicityServingCell": 10
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Optional validation steps:
- Start DU with increased ASN.1 verbosity (`Asn1_verbosity: annoying`) already present to confirm encoding success.
- Grep DU logs for "SIB1" and ensure no asserts around `encode_SIB_NR`.
- Verify UE connects to `127.0.0.1:4043` (connection established) and proceeds to random access.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated around the crash; exact preconditions before the assert are inferred from typical OAI flow, but the error message directly names the failing IE, making the root cause unambiguous.
- Full `ue_conf` rfsim client parameters are not shown; however, repeated `errno(111)` indicates the server side (DU) is down, consistent with DU crash.
- While 38.331 defines enumerated periodicities, different OAI builds may accept numeric forms mapping to enumerations; still, `9` is invalid in all cases.
