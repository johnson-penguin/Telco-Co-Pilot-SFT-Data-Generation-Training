## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR in SA mode using the RF simulator. The CU initializes NGAP and GTP-U and starts F1AP towards the DU. The DU starts NR L1/MAC but exits early due to configuration validation failure. The UE starts and repeatedly tries to connect to the RF simulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043 but receives connection refused because the DU (server side) is not running after its early exit.

From network_config:
- CU `gNBs.tracking_area_code` = 1
- DU `gNBs[0].tracking_area_code` = 0 (misconfigured)
- UE has only UICC/DNN; RF sim client connects to 127.0.0.1:4043

The misconfigured_param explicitly states `tracking_area_code=0`. In OAI, TAC is validated to be in [1..65533]. A value of 0 triggers a configuration error and immediate exit of the softmodem before serving as RF simulator server and before F1 setup with CU. Expected flow (init → NGAP setup (CU↔AMF) → F1AP setup (CU↔DU) → RF sim active → UE PRACH/RRC attach) is interrupted at DU config check.

Initial mismatches/flags:
- DU TAC=0 conflicts with CU TAC=1 and violates allowed range. This is sufficient to cause DU termination.
- Because DU terminates, UE cannot connect to RF simulator server and loops on connection attempts.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key CU events:
- Confirms SA mode; initializes NGAP and GTP-U.
- Sends NGSetupRequest and receives NGSetupResponse from AMF successfully.
- Starts F1AP at CU and attempts to open SCTP towards DU at 127.0.0.5.

No anomalies on CU side regarding AMF connectivity. CU is waiting for DU F1 connection; no F1AP DU association occurs (consistent with DU exit). Network interface parameters in CU config (NGU/NG-AMF IP 192.168.8.43, S1U port 2152) align with logs showing GTP-U init. Nothing indicates CU-side misconfiguration relevant to TAC.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
DU starts properly until configuration validation:
- Initializes NR L1/MAC/PHY contexts.
- Fails config check with: `config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 0 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533`.
- Then `config_execcheck` reports wrong parameter count and exits via `exit_fun`.

Because the process exits during configuration, DU never reaches F1 setup nor RF simulator server startup. No PHY/MAC runtime errors (e.g., PRACH) appear because execution never reaches that stage.

Link to network_config: DU `gNBs[0].tracking_area_code` is indeed 0, matching the error. CU has TAC=1; while mismatch alone could be tolerated depending on core behavior, the primary blocker is that 0 is out-of-range per OAI validation and 3GPP conventions (TAC 0 reserved/not valid for broadcast).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
UE initializes PHY and threads, then repeatedly attempts to connect to RF simulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043, receiving errno(111) connection refused. This is a direct consequence of DU exiting before bringing up the RF simulator server endpoint. There are no RRC/PRACH attempts logged because the RF link never establishes.

UE config contains only SIM and DNN; RF sim addressing defaults to localhost client behavior, consistent with the logs. No UE-side misconfiguration is implicated.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU completes NGAP with AMF and starts F1AP, awaiting DU.
  - DU exits immediately on config validation due to TAC=0 (out of allowed range 1..65533).
  - UE, acting as RF sim client, cannot connect because DU never starts the server at 127.0.0.1:4043.

- Root cause: Misconfigured DU `tracking_area_code=0`. This violates OAI config rules and practical deployment rules; consequently the DU process exits during startup. The CU remains idle on F1AP; UE cannot connect to RF sim.

No additional spec lookup is required beyond OAI’s explicit validation in logs; this is a deterministic configuration error.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix: Set DU TAC to a valid, non-zero value matching CU (e.g., 1). Ensure consistency across components to avoid paging/registration area mismatches.

Corrected network_config snippets:

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "gNB_ID": "0xe00",
        "gNB_DU_ID": "0xe00",
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-DU",
        "tracking_area_code": 1,  // changed from 0 to 1 to satisfy [1..65533] and match CU
        "plmn_list": [
          { "mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2, "snssaiList": [{ "sst": 1, "sd": "0x010203" }] }
        ]
        // ... rest unchanged ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Optionally verify CU alignment (already TAC=1):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "gNB_ID": "0xe00",
      "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
      "tracking_area_code": 1  // unchanged; consistent with DU
      // ... rest unchanged ...
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after change:
- Restart DU; confirm no `config_check_intrange` errors.
- Observe DU starting RF simulator server (listen on 127.0.0.1:4043).
- UE should connect successfully; then monitor PRACH, RRC connection setup, and registration with AMF via CU.
- Verify F1AP association established between CU and DU.

If further issues arise (e.g., PRACH/RRC):
- Check SSB/PRACH parameters (already appear reasonable: FR1 n78, 106 PRBs, SCS 30 kHz).
- Ensure `plmn_list` and `snssai` align with core network config.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; however, the DU error message is explicit and sufficient.
- Only a subset of CU/DU config is shown; other mismatches could exist but are not implicated here.
- UE config omits RF sim server settings (defaults used); not an issue once DU runs.

Conclusion: The single misconfiguration `tracking_area_code=0` in DU config causes an immediate exit, preventing RF sim service and halting the end-to-end attach. Set TAC to a valid non-zero value (e.g., 1) to resolve.
