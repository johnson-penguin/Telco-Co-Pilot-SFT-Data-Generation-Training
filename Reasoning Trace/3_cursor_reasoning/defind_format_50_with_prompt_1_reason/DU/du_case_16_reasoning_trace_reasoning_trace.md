## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The deployment runs OAI in Standalone (SA) mode over RF simulator: CU and DU logs show "running in SA mode"; UE runs as rfsim client.
- Expected sequence: CU init → NGAP setup with AMF → F1AP between CU/DU → DU brings up PHY/MAC and RF simulator server → UE connects to rfsim → PRACH/RA → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Provided network_config shows key parameters:
  - CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43` which matches CU logs; NGSetupRequest/Response succeeded.
  - DU `servingCellConfigCommon[0]`: FR1 n78, SCS 30 kHz (mu=1), 106 PRBs, `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98`, TDD Pattern1: 7 DL, 2 UL, 6 DL symbols, 4 UL symbols. Critically: `pucchGroupHopping=3`.
  - UE: IMSI and keys; frequency derived at runtime to 3619200000 Hz (n78) matches DU.
- misconfigured_param: `pucchGroupHopping=3` (guide diagnosis). In 3GPP TS 38.331 `PUCCH-ConfigCommon` → `pucch-GroupHopping` is ENUMERATED {neither(0), enable(1), disable(2)}. Value 3 is invalid.

Initial hypothesis: An invalid PUCCH group hopping enum in DU RRC common config causes ASN.1 encoding failure for `PUCCH-ConfigCommon` during SIB/ServingCellConfigCommon cloning, crashing DU before it can host the rfsim server; consequently, UE cannot connect (errno 111).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU initializes correctly, sets up NGAP with AMF:
  - NGSetupRequest sent; NGSetupResponse received.
  - GTP-U configured at 192.168.8.43:2152; CU F1AP starts and opens SCTP toward DU (`F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5`).
- No fatal errors or stalls in CU logs; CU is ready and waiting for DU F1 connection.
- Cross-check with config: CU addresses (NG/NGU 192.168.8.43) align with logs. Nothing here suggests CU-side root cause.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC with expected FR1/n78 parameters: mu=1, N_RB=106, SSB at 641280 (3619.2 MHz), TDD period index=6; antenna ports reported.
- Critical failure sequence:
  - After RRC prints ServingCellConfigCommon and SIB1 hints, an assertion triggers:
    - `Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed!`
    - `In clone_pucch_configcommon() ... nr_rrc_config.c:183`
    - `could not clone NR_PUCCH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding`
    - Followed by `Exiting OAI softmodem` and `_Assert_Exit_` at the same location.
- This pinpoints the failure to ASN.1 encoding of `PUCCH-ConfigCommon` derived from `servingCellConfigCommon` in DU config.
- Given misconfigured_param `pucchGroupHopping=3`, the encoder likely receives an out-of-range enum, causing `enc_rval.encoded <= 0` and the assert in `clone_pucch_configcommon`.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE configures FR1/n78 at 3619200000 Hz and starts rfsim client.
- Repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim server `127.0.0.1:4043`, failing with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- This is consistent with DU having crashed before starting its rfsim server loop; thus, the UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU reaches steady state awaiting F1.
  - DU crashes during RRC configuration encoding at `clone_pucch_configcommon`, so F1 from DU side never comes up and rfsim server never opens.
  - UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 (server not listening) because DU is down.
- Root cause:
  - DU `servingCellConfigCommon[0].pucchGroupHopping=3` is invalid. Per 3GPP TS 38.331, `pucch-GroupHopping` is ENUMERATED with 3 legal states: neither(0), enable(1), disable(2). Value 3 is out-of-range, leading to ASN.1 encoding failure of `PUCCH-ConfigCommon` in OAI RRC (as evidenced by the exact assert path and message).
- Secondary checks:
  - Other parameters (PRACH index 98, zeroCorrelationZoneConfig 13, TDD pattern) appear plausible for FR1 SCS30 and do not show errors in logs before the PUCCH assert.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix: Set `pucchGroupHopping` to a valid value based on your intended hopping behavior:
  - 0 → neither (no group hopping, no sequence hopping)
  - 1 → enable (group hopping enabled, sequence hopping disabled)
  - 2 → disable (group hopping disabled, sequence hopping enabled)
- Commonly used stable setting in OAI examples is `0` (neither). Also ensure `hoppingId` is present if required by your chosen mode (it exists here as 40, acceptable).
- After changing, restart DU; it should pass RRC encoding, bring up rfsim server, accept UE client, and proceed with RA/RRC.

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "servingCellConfigCommon": [
            {
              "_comment_pucchGroupHopping": "Fixed invalid enum 3 → 0 (neither). Valid: 0 neither, 1 enable, 2 disable.",
              "pucchGroupHopping": 0
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Optional: if you prefer sequence hopping only, use 2; for group hopping only, use 1.

Post-fix validation steps:
- Start DU with increased ASN.1 verbosity (`Asn1_verbosity=annoying`) and confirm no `clone_pucch_configcommon` asserts.
- Verify DU listens on rfsim port 4043 (netstat/lsof) and UE connects without `errno(111)`.
- Observe PRACH MSG1/MSG2 exchange in DU/UE logs; ensure RRC Setup is sent/received.
- Confirm F1AP setup completes between CU and DU (F1AP SCTP established, GNB-DU CONFIG UPDATE at CU).

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are partial and without explicit timestamps; we infer ordering from print sequence.
- Only the failing assertion context is shown; while other config parameters could influence behavior, the assert location and known enum domain strongly implicate `pucchGroupHopping`.
- Mapping 0/1/2 to neither/enable/disable follows OAI’s typical internal mapping consistent with TS 38.331; if using alternative branches, confirm mappings in your source tree.
