## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The system runs OAI 5G NR in SA mode with RF Simulator. CU logs show NGAP setup with AMF and F1AP initialization; DU logs show NR L1/MAC bring-up; UE logs show repeated attempts to connect to the RF simulator server on 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU boots and connects to AMF → DU boots and exposes rfsim server → F1-C setup CU↔DU → SIB1 scheduling → UE connects to RFSim server → PRACH (Msg1/Msg2) → RRC attach → PDU session.
- The provided misconfiguration is pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=0 in the DU `gnb.conf` JSON. This parameter controls the number of PDSCH antenna ports in the XP group (cross-polarized or additional port bundle) used by OAI’s internal antenna port accounting for downlink.
- From network_config:
  - CU: NGU/NGAP bound to 192.168.8.43; F1-C local is 127.0.0.5 (matches logs).
  - DU: `pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2`, `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=0`, `pusch_AntennaPorts=4`, `maxMIMO_layers=1`, RU has `nb_tx=4`, `nb_rx=4`, rfsimulator server listens on port 4043.
  - UE: IMSI and basic auth; UE tries 127.0.0.1:4043 (matches DU server expectation when running on same host).
- Immediate mismatch: DU sets `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=0`. DU logs show an assertion on antenna-related layer limits leading to early exit, preventing the RF simulator server from accepting UE connections.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU confirms SA mode, initializes NGAP, sends NGSetupRequest, receives NGSetupResponse, and starts F1AP at CU:
  - “[NGAP] Send NGSetupRequest … Received NGSetupResponse …”
  - “[F1AP] Starting F1AP at CU … F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5 …”
- GTP-U configured for 192.168.8.43:2152; CU waits for DU to establish F1-C association. No CU-side error is visible—CU is healthy but idle awaiting DU.
- Cross-check with `cu_conf`: NGU and NGAP IPs match `192.168.8.43`; F1-C local address `127.0.0.5` matches logs. No CU config issue indicated.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU boots in SA mode, initializes NR PHY and MAC. Key lines:
  - “[GNB_APP] pdsch_AntennaPorts N1 2 N2 1 XP 0 pusch_AntennaPorts 4”
  - “Assertion (config.maxMIMO_layers != 0 && config.maxMIMO_layers <= tot_ant) failed! … Invalid maxMIMO_layers 1 … Exiting execution”
- Interpretation in OAI’s `RCconfig_nr_macrlc` path:
  - OAI computes a total available DL antenna ports count (`tot_ant`) from configured PDSCH antenna-port groups and RU capabilities. Certain code paths require a non-zero XP group when other flags/structures are present; with `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=0`, the computed `tot_ant` for the selected configuration can collapse to 0 for PDSCH, even if RU `nb_tx=4` and N1/N2 are non-zero.
  - The assertion enforces 0 < `maxMIMO_layers` ≤ `tot_ant`. With `tot_ant=0` (due to XP=0 path), even `maxMIMO_layers=1` violates the condition and triggers abort.
- The crash happens during MAC/RLC configuration; DU terminates before starting the rfsim server loop and before F1-U/F1-C association with the CU. This explains downstream UE connection failures.
- Cross-check with `du_conf`: indeed `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP: 0` is set; `maxMIMO_layers: 1` is compliant in general but becomes invalid if `tot_ant` is computed as 0 by the XP=0 configuration path.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY and HW chains and then attempts to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, failing with errno(111) (connection refused):
  - “[HW] Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 … connect() … failed, errno(111)”
- This is a direct consequence of the DU crash: with DU not running, the rfsimulator server socket is not listening, so the UE cannot connect, and the access procedure never begins (no PRACH attempts are visible).

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU is healthy and waiting for DU (F1AP at CU started).
  - DU crashes during config due to antenna-port accounting assertion in `RCconfig_nr_macrlc`.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim because DU is down → repeated errno(111).
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=0` in DU triggers an invalid PDSCH antenna port composition, leading to `tot_ant=0` for the selected DL porting mode and violating the invariant 0 < `maxMIMO_layers` ≤ `tot_ant`.
- Why XP=0 is problematic here:
  - In OAI, the effective number of PDSCH ports used for scheduling can depend on the XP group when specific combinations of N1/N2/XPs and precoding flags are set. Setting XP to zero while other structures (e.g., N1/N2 values and RU `nb_tx=4`) imply multi-port operation can select a branch where the XP contribution is required to be non-zero. This produces an inconsistent DL port budget for PDSCH and triggers the assert.
- Therefore, the DU never reaches operational state; CU and UE behavior are secondary effects.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

1) Correct the DU PDSCH antenna port configuration
   - Set `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP` to a positive value consistent with RU `nb_tx` and intended MIMO layers. Typical safe values with a 4×4 RU:
     - Keep `pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2`, and set `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2` to reflect two cross-polarized ports, giving a non-zero XP contribution. With `maxMIMO_layers=1`, the assert condition is satisfied since `tot_ant ≥ 1`.
   - Alternatively, reduce the setup to a minimal single-port DL by setting N1/N2/XP to a combination that results in a single effective port, but ensure OAI’s code path yields `tot_ant≥1`.

2) Validate with DU logs
   - After the change, DU should pass `RCconfig_nr_macrlc` without assertion, start rfsim server, log SIB1 scheduling, and proceed to F1 setup.

3) End-to-end check
   - UE should connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 successfully; PRACH and RRC procedures should start. CU F1AP should show association established.

4) Optional deeper checks
   - Verify `do_precoding` alignment in `RUs` (currently 0) with your antenna port strategy.
   - If increasing `maxMIMO_layers`, ensure it never exceeds the computed total DL antenna ports after the port configuration change.

Proposed corrected snippets (annotated):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-DU",
          "pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1": 2,
          "pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP": 2, // changed from 0 → ensure non-zero XP ports
          "pusch_AntennaPorts": 4,
          "maxMIMO_layers": 1,        // remains ≤ total antenna ports
          "RUs": [
            // unchanged here; confirm nb_tx=4, nb_rx=4 aligns with intended DL ports
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If you prefer a strictly minimal single-port DL setup (for testing a single layer):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1": 1, // reduce to one N1 port
          "pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP": 0, // keep 0 XP only if OAI path still yields tot_ant≥1
          "maxMIMO_layers": 1         // must still satisfy 0 < layers ≤ tot_ant
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The second snippet is only valid if OAI’s port accounting yields `tot_ant ≥ 1` without XP; if a subsequent assert appears, revert to the first snippet with XP=2.

No CU or UE config changes are required for this specific issue. Ensure the UE uses the same host as DU (or adjust `serveraddr`) and that frequencies/SSB parameters match DU SIB1 if you proceed further.

## 7. Limitations

- The DU assertion originates from OAI’s internal accounting of antenna ports; exact `tot_ant` computation details depend on code paths not fully shown here, but the log and configuration strongly implicate `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=0` as the trigger.
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; we infer order by typical OAI bring-up sequence.
- UE configuration excerpt is minimal; we assume its RF simulator destination is 127.0.0.1 (as seen in logs). If UE runs on another host, adjust addressing accordingly.
