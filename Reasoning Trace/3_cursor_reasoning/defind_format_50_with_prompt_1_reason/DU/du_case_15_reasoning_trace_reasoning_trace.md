## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The deployment runs OAI in SA mode with RFsim: CU and DU both print running in SA mode and the UE attempts to connect to an RF simulator at 127.0.0.1:4043. Expected sequence: CU boots and registers to AMF (NGAP), F1 is brought up to the DU, DU initializes PHY/MAC and encodes SIBs/ServingCellConfigCommon, then UE synchronizes, detects SSB, performs PRACH (Msg1..Msg4), RRC setup, and PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter is rsrp_ThresholdSSB=-1 inside DU `servingCellConfigCommon`. This value is used in RACH/SSB-based access gating and must adhere to ASN.1 constraints from 3GPP TS 38.331.
- Network config highlights:
  - CU: NG interface IPs are 192.168.8.43; NGSetup to AMF succeeds per logs.
  - DU: `servingCellConfigCommon[0]` sets NR cell on N78, 106 PRBs, TDD config, PRACH parameters with `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98`, `zeroCorrelationZoneConfig=13`, and `rsrp_ThresholdSSB=-1` (the focal misconfig).
  - UE: Keys/IMSI present; RF/logs show correct numerology (mu=1), band/frequency 3619.2 MHz consistent with DU.
- Immediate mismatch: `rsrp_ThresholdSSB` is negative (-1). By spec, rsrp-ThresholdSSB is an integer with domain 0..127 (mapped to dBm levels), so -1 violates ASN.1 constraints and will fail encoding of the RRC structure that carries RACH config (part of SIB1/ServingCellConfigCommon).

What to look for:
- CU: NGAP up, F1 start request.
- DU: RRC encoding step for RACH/ServingCellConfigCommon; ASN.1 encode assertions.
- UE: Repeated RFsim connection failures if the DU process crashes before hosting the RFsim server.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- NG path up:
  - NGSetupRequest/Response exchange completes and CU reports associated AMF 1, so core connectivity is fine.
  - F1AP at CU starts and opens SCTP to 127.0.0.5 (local loopback as per split CU/DU on same host setup).
- No subsequent UE-related RRC/NGAP activity is observed, consistent with a downstream DU/PHY bring-up failure preventing any UE attach.
- CU network_config matches logs: `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` 192.168.8.43 appears in GTPU config lines, aligning with the CU behavior.

Conclusion (CU): Healthy; waiting for DU/UE. No evidence the issue originates at CU.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC and parses ServingCellConfigCommon with band 78, ABSFREQSSB 641280 (3619.2 MHz), TDD: slots and symbols allocations logged.
- Critical failure:
  - Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed!
  - In clone_rach_configcommon() ../../../openair2/RRC/NR/nr_rrc_config.c:130
  - could not clone NR_RACH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding
  - Exiting OAI softmodem / _Assert_Exit_
- This is a classic OAI RRC ASN.1 encoding failure that occurs when a field in RACH/ServingCellConfigCommon violates ASN.1 constraints or internal value checks. Given the misconfigured parameter, the prime suspect is `rsrp_ThresholdSSB=-1` (invalid domain), which would cause encoding of the RACH/SIB structures to fail.
- Because the DU exits, it never binds the RFsim server socket. That explains subsequent UE connection failures to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Conclusion (DU): The DU crashes during RRC encoding of RACH/ServingCellConfigCommon due to an invalid configuration value, halting bring-up.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE PHY init matches DU numerology: mu=1, N_RB=106, 3619.2 MHz for DL/UL.
- Repeats attempts to connect to RFsim server 127.0.0.1:4043 with errno(111) (connection refused) in a loop.
- This is consistent with the DU process having crashed before starting the RFsim server listener; thus, UE cannot connect.

Conclusion (UE): No RF/sync failure per se; the UE cannot connect because the DU is down.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline linkage:
  - CU completes NG setup and starts F1, then idles.
  - DU reaches RRC encoding, asserts in clone_rach_configcommon(), exits.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim because server is not listening (DU dead).
- Guided by the known misconfiguration: `rsrp_ThresholdSSB=-1` is outside 3GPP TS 38.331 allowed range (0..127). Such a value breaks ASN.1 constraints and causes encoding failure when populating ServingCellConfigCommon/RACH-ConfigCommon/SIB1. That precisely matches the DU assertion location and behavior.
- Therefore, the root cause is an invalid `rsrp_ThresholdSSB` in DU `servingCellConfigCommon`, leading to RRC ASN.1 encoding failure and DU termination, cascading into UE connection refusal and CU inactivity regarding UE procedures.

Note: `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98` and other PRACH fields look plausible for FR1/mu=1; there is no conflicting evidence around PRACH itself in the logs beyond the general RACH config encode failure. The negative threshold is the specific violation.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fix:
- Set `rsrp_ThresholdSSB` to a valid integer in [0, 127]. Typical choices depend on deployment; for permissive access in lab/rfsim, values around 30â€“60 are common. Example: 40 corresponds to a moderate threshold.

Proposed corrected snippets (showing only fields that change/stakeholders care about):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "servingCellConfigCommon": [
            {
              "rsrp_ThresholdSSB": 40
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update DU config, restart DU first (ensuring RFsim server binds), then start UE; verify UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Watch DU logs at RRC bring-up to confirm no assert; check SIB1 generation logs.
- Validate end-to-end by observing PRACH, RRC Setup, Registration, and PDU session in CU/DU/UE logs.

Further checks (optional hardening):
- Ensure all ServingCellConfigCommon values comply with ASN.1 and OAI internal checks. Keep `Asn1_verbosity=annoying` during validation to catch future misconfigs quickly.
- If any additional encode errors appear, re-verify related fields (e.g., `ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB`, `prach_RootSequenceIndex_PR`, `preambleTransMax`) for domain validity.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; exact ordering is inferred but consistent.
- External confirmation of value ranges was based on 3GPP TS 38.331 semantics for `rsrp-ThresholdSSB` (domain 0..127 mapping to dBm steps). The precise mapping is not required to assert invalidity of -1.
- While other parameters could also trigger encode failures, the given misconfigured parameter directly explains the observed assertion and system behavior.
