## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

From the logs, the setup is SA mode with OAI `nr-softmodem` components and rfsimulator:
- CU shows SA mode and starts NGAP, GTP-U, and F1AP threads.
- DU shows SA mode, initializes PHY/MAC, configures TDD, and attempts F1-C SCTP association to the CU.
- UE initializes SA PHY and repeatedly tries to connect to the rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.

Expected flow in OAI SA+rfsim:
1) CU initializes, binds F1-C SCTP server, and establishes NGAP SCTP association to AMF via NG interface.
2) DU connects to CU over F1-C (SCTP). After F1 Setup Response, DU activates radio and rfsim server starts serving IQ.
3) UE connects to rfsim server, synchronizes, performs PRACH, receives SIBs, completes RRC attach, and PDU session.

Input guidance (misconfigured_param):
- "gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=999.999.999.999" in CU config. This is the CU's local IPv4 address used for NG (toward AMF). `999.999.999.999` is invalid, so we expect CU NGAP SCTP stack to fail DNS/address resolution or binding/connect, impacting overall bring-up.

Parsed network_config essentials:
- CU `amf_ip_address.ipv4`: 192.168.70.132 (AMF address). Correct-looking private IP.
- CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES`:
  - `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF`: 999.999.999.999 (invalid; should be the CU host IP reachable by AMF)
  - `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU`: 192.168.8.43 (GTP-U local address used for user plane)
  - `GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U`: 2152
- CU F1 (split): `local_s_address` 127.0.0.5, `remote_s_address` 127.0.0.3 (matches DU side)
- DU F1: local 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5; rfsimulator server: port 4043
- DU serving cell: band n78, μ=1, DL/UL 3619.2 MHz, BW 106 RB; PRACH index 98 (plausible). Nothing stands out wrong in DU PHY/MAC config.
- UE: IMSI etc., RF params not explicitly shown; logs show 3619.2 MHz consistent with DU.

Immediate mismatch signals:
- CU log: "Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 999.999.999.999" followed by SCTP association assertion and `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999) failed`. This directly aligns with the misconfigured NG local IP.
- DU cannot get F1 Setup Response and thus does not activate radio; UE cannot connect to rfsim server.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Key events:
- SA mode confirmed; threads for SCTP, NGAP, RRC, GTP-U, CU-F1 created.
- GTP-U configured at 192.168.8.43:2152 (user plane local). This succeeds.
- F1AP at CU starts, and a socket for CU F1-C is created for 127.0.0.5.
- Then assertion in `sctp_handle_new_association_req()` with `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999) failed: Name or service not known`.

Interpretation:
- The CU attempts to resolve/bind/connect using the configured NG interface IP. The invalid IP literal leads to `getaddrinfo` failure and an assert, terminating the CU.
- Consequence: CU dies before it can accept F1-C connections from the DU and before completing NGAP association to AMF.

Cross-reference with config:
- `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` must be a valid IPv4 of the CU host interface used for NGAP to reach the AMF (`amf_ip_address.ipv4`). It is set to an impossible address; the log confirms CU parses and uses it, then fails.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Key initialization:
- PHY/MAC initialized; TDD pattern configured; frequencies and numerology consistent with n78 at 3.6192 GHz; PRACH and SIB parameters parsed.
- F1AP DU: attempts to connect from 127.0.0.3 to CU 127.0.0.5; multiple `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` retries.
- DU reports "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" repeatedly.

Interpretation:
- CU is not listening on F1-C (because it crashed on NG setup). Hence the DU's SCTP connect is refused by the OS.
- Due to OAI DU gating, RU/radio activation (including rfsim server behavior) is deferred until F1 Setup completes; thus the UE will find no rfsim server accepting connections.

Link to config:
- F1 addresses match between CU and DU (127.0.0.5 ↔ 127.0.0.3). No DU-side parameter points to the observed failure; it's entirely dependent on CU availability.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Key observations:
- UE is configured for SA with parameters matching DU (3619.2 MHz, μ=1, 106 RB).
- It acts as rfsimulator client trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and continuously gets `errno(111)` (connection refused).

Interpretation:
- In OAI rfsim, the DU typically runs the rfsim server and listens on the configured port (4043). Because DU is waiting for F1 Setup (blocked by CU crash), the server is not accepting connections yet. Hence the UE's repeated connection refusal aligns with the DU's blocked state.

Cross-check with DU:
- DU log explicitly states waiting for F1 Setup before radio activation; UE side refusal loops line up temporally.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU starts → tries to process NG configuration → fails on invalid NG interface IP → asserts and exits.
- DU attempts F1-C to CU → connection refused (no CU listening) → DU stalls prior to radio activation.
- UE tries rfsim client connect to localhost:4043 → connection refused because DU never activated rfsim server.

Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param):
- The CU's NG local interface IP `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` is invalid (`999.999.999.999`). This triggers `getaddrinfo` failure and an assert in the SCTP handling path, killing the CU.
- Secondary effects propagate: DU cannot complete F1 Setup; UE cannot connect to rfsim server; the entire SA attach path is blocked at the earliest control-plane step.

Spec/code knowledge:
- NGAP uses SCTP over IPv4. The CU must bind/connect using a valid local IP that is routable to the AMF. Invalid IPs will fail address resolution APIs like `getaddrinfo`, leading to initialization abort.
- Although user-plane GTP-U (192.168.8.43) was configured, it is irrelevant until control-plane is established.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Primary fix:
- Set `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` to a valid IPv4 address of the CU host interface that can reach the AMF at 192.168.70.132. Example: if the CU host has `192.168.70.141/24` on the same network as the AMF, use that. Ensure routing/firewall permits SCTP (NGAP, typically port 38412) between CU and AMF.

Additional validations:
- Verify CU can ping the AMF IP 192.168.70.132 and that SCTP is allowed (e.g., `lksctp-tools`, `ss -tuan | grep 38412`).
- Keep `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU` pointing to the correct user-plane interface; this can differ from NG interface.
- Confirm F1 addresses remain loopback (127.0.0.5/127.0.0.3) for rfsim topology, which is fine.
- After fixing CU and restarting, observe DU obtaining F1 Setup Response, then rfsim server accepting connections; UE should then connect and proceed to SIB/RA.

Proposed corrected snippets (illustrative; replace with your actual CU host NG IP):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "amf_ip_address": { "ipv4": "192.168.70.132" },
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.70.141",  // FIX: set to CU host NG IP reachable by AMF
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",       // keep as the user-plane local IP
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        }
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server",                             // DU hosts rfsim server
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "uicc0": {
        "imsi": "001010000000001",
        "dnn": "oai",
        "nssai_sst": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update CU config to the valid NG IP.
- Restart CU; verify no `getaddrinfo`/SCTP asserts; confirm NGAP association established to AMF.
- Start DU; verify F1 Setup completes; ensure DU logs indicate radio activation.
- Start UE; check rfsim connects and UE proceeds to RRC attach.

If issues persist:
- Check routes between CU NG interface and AMF, and confirm SCTP port availability.
- Ensure the CU host actually owns the IP configured in `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF`.


## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack explicit timestamps; exact ordering is inferred from typical OAI startup sequences.
- The correct CU NG IP is environment-specific; `192.168.70.141` above is an example—replace with the real CU host IP on the AMF-reachable network.
- UE-side configuration beyond IMSI is not fully shown; assumptions about rfsim topology follow OAI defaults.
