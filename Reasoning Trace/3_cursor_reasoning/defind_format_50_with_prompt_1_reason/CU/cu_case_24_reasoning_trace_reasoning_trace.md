## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- This is an OAI NR SA deployment using rfsim: CU/DU split over F1, UE in rfsim mode. DU logs show SA mode and F1AP client; UE logs show rfsim client attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected bring-up: CU loads config → starts NGAP/GTPU and F1C server role → DU starts, reads cell config, opens F1C client to CU → DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server, searches SSB, performs PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Given misconfigured_param: security.drb_integrity=None. This hints the CU config contains an invalid value for a security field controlling DRB integrity, which OAI does not accept in that form.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs: F1C local 127.0.0.5, DU remote 127.0.0.3; SCTP streams 2/2; NGU on 192.168.8.43; AMF at 192.168.70.132.
- cu_conf.security: ciphering_algorithms [nea3, nea2, nea1, nea0]; integrity_algorithms [nia2, nia0]; drb_ciphering yes. No explicit drb_integrity field is present in this JSON representation (it likely exists in the actual .conf used and is mis-set to None).
- du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon: SSB at absFreqSSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz, band n78, 106 PRBs, TDD pattern plausible; prach_ConfigurationIndex 98 etc.
- du_conf.rfsimulator.serveraddr "server" and port 4043, meaning DU is the rfsim server and should listen locally for UE connections when radio is activated.
- ue_conf: IMSI/dnn only; UE tries to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 per logs (default).

Immediate mismatch spotted from logs vs configs:
- CU logs show a libconfig syntax error and aborted initialization. That prevents F1C server from coming up. Consequently, DU cannot complete F1 Setup and will not activate radio, so the rfsim server on DU never starts listening; hence UE connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 is refused. The misconfigured_param points to the CU config line likely being the cause of the parser error.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Key lines:
  - "[LIBCONFIG] file ... cu_case_24.conf - line 77: syntax error"
  - "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded" → config_get skipped → "LOG init aborted" → "Getting configuration failed" → nr-softmodem invoked with -O that .conf → "function config_libconfig_init returned -1".
- Interpretation: The CU .conf contains a syntactic token that libconfig cannot parse. The provided misconfigured_param security.drb_integrity=None matches such a case: libconfig format expects values like yes/no strings or specific enumerations; unquoted None (or an unsupported literal) causes a parse error at that line.
- Cross-reference: cu_conf JSON here does not include drb_integrity, but the actual .conf referenced by the logs likely does and is set to None, triggering the error before any runtime initialization (so no NGAP/F1/GTPU servers start).

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Initialization proceeds: RAN context init, PDSCH/PUSCH antenna ports, TDD config, cell config parsed (SSB frequency 3619.2 MHz, n78, 106 PRB). No PHY/MAC assertion; PRACH parameters look valid (prach_ConfigurationIndex 98, ZCZC 13 etc.).
- Networking: F1AP starts, DU attempts SCTP to CU: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" followed by repeated "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and retries. This matches CU not listening (it crashed at config loading).
- DU state machine: "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio"; thus it does not activate radio nor rfsim server until F1 setup completes.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE PHY initializes for 3619.2 MHz, 106 PRB, numerology 1, TDD.
- Immediately tries rfsim TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and repeatedly gets errno 111 (connection refused). This indicates no server listening on that port.
- Correlation: DU is configured as rfsim server (serveraddr "server"), but it only starts once DU activates radio after F1 setup. Since CU failed, F1 setup never completes, so the server never starts; hence UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline:
  1) CU fails at config parse due to syntax error at line 77.
  2) F1C server not started; DU SCTP to CU refused endlessly.
  3) DU stays pre-activation; rfsim server not listening.
  4) UE connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 refused repeatedly.
- Guided by misconfigured_param security.drb_integrity=None: In OAI, DRB integrity protection is typically not supported/used for user-plane data; control-plane SRBs use integrity. The config option for DRB integrity, when present, must be a supported boolean-like value or specific keyword. Setting it to None is both semantically incorrect for PDCP config and syntactically invalid for libconfig if unquoted or unsupported, causing the exact parser failure seen.
- Therefore, the primary root cause is a bad CU configuration token for DRB integrity that breaks libconfig parsing, preventing CU startup and cascading failures across DU and UE.

Note on specifications and OAI behavior:
- 3GPP allows UP integrity as optional; many implementations disable DRB integrity due to performance/handset interop. OAI typically exposes ciphering/integrity algorithms lists and may expose a switch like drb_ciphering and sometimes a drb_integrity flag. Acceptable values are usually yes/no or true/false in libconfig syntax, not None.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate configuration fixes:
- In the CU .conf (the one failing at line 77), replace the invalid security.drb_integrity=None with a supported value or remove it entirely:
  - If the intent is to disable DRB integrity: set drb_integrity = "no"; or rely on default behavior by removing the field (since integrity_algorithms for UP may not be applied to DRBs in OAI).
  - Ensure values follow libconfig syntax: unquoted identifiers like yes/no are supported; if using strings, quote them consistently. Avoid None.

Validated snippets (within your network_config structure) illustrating the change:

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "security": {
      "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
      "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],
      "drb_ciphering": "yes",
      "drb_integrity": "no" // changed from None → no; disables DRB integrity using a valid value
    }
  }
}
```

If your libconfig .conf uses non-JSON syntax, the equivalent would be:

```ini
security = {
  ciphering_algorithms = ("nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0");
  integrity_algorithms = ("nia2","nia0");
  drb_ciphering = yes;
  drb_integrity = no; // was None; fix parse and semantics
};
```

Operational checks after the fix:
- Start CU; verify no libconfig errors and that NGAP/F1AP come up (logs should show F1C listening on 127.0.0.5 and NGAP connecting to AMF).
- Start DU; confirm F1 SCTP connects and F1 Setup Response received; DU should log radio activation and rfsim time source active.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds, SSB detected, PRACH/RA completes, RRC connection established.

Further analysis/tools if issues persist:
- If you still see parse errors, search the CU .conf around line 77 for other invalid tokens or missing commas/semicolons. Ensure all security fields use supported values.
- If DRB integrity is actually required for a test, be aware of handset and OAI support; validate PDCP behavior with wireshark (NR-RRC/PDCP) and OAI pdcp logs.
- Ensure CU’s F1C addresses match DU (here they do: CU 127.0.0.5, DU 127.0.0.3, ports 500/501 correct pairing).

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated to startup windows; we infer DU rfsim server activation is gated on F1 Setup based on typical OAI behavior and the explicit log "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio".
- The provided JSON cu_conf snapshot does not contain the drb_integrity field; we rely on the misconfigured_param and CU error to conclude the actual .conf included it as None and caused the syntax error.
- Exact accepted tokens for drb_integrity can vary by OAI revision; if no such key exists in your branch, remove it instead of setting it.
