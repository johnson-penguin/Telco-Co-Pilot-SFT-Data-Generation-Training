## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup runs OAI 5G NR in SA with rfsim. CU and DU are split via F1 (CU at `127.0.0.5`, DU at `127.0.0.3`). UE uses rfsimulator as a client attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Expected call flow: process startup → F1AP association (DU↔CU) → DU activates radio → rfsimulator server listens → UE connects to rfsim → SSB sync → PRACH/RA → RRC attach → NAS security → PDU session.

Key configuration excerpts parsed:
- gNB-CU `security.integrity_algorithms = ["nia9", "nia0"]` (invalid first preference)
- DU `servingCellConfigCommon.prach_ConfigurationIndex = 98`, band n78, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106, TDD pattern OK
- UE IMSI/key/opc configured; rfsim client to `127.0.0.1:4043`

Immediate mismatch: CU log explicitly reports unknown integrity algorithm "nia9". OAI supports `nia0`, `nia1`, `nia2` (128-NIA1/2/3), not `nia9`. With a fatal config error at CU, F1 cannot establish, blocking DU activation and rfsim server exposure, which then causes UE connection failures.

Guiding misconfiguration: `security.integrity_algorithms[0] = nia9`.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Confirms SA mode and CU identity, then:
  - `[RRC]   unknown integrity algorithm "nia9" in section "security" of the configuration file`
  - Normal config parsing lines follow, but the presence of the explicit unknown algorithm error indicates the CU rejects the config or operates without completing RRC/F1 setup. There are no subsequent NGAP or F1AP accept indications.
- Cross-reference with config:
  - `security.integrity_algorithms[0] = "nia9"` is invalid; should be one of `nia2`, `nia1`, `nia0` for AS security integrity preferences.
- Consequence: CU does not accept F1 associations from DU; no SCTP server established at CU for F1 or it rejects the association early.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly and computes TDD pattern, band n78, SSB frequency 3.6192 GHz, N_RB 106.
- F1AP attempts to connect to CU:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated: `[SCTP]   Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by F1AP retry loops.
  - DU prints: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` and keeps retrying.
- Interpretation: With CU failing due to `nia9`, SCTP association to CU is refused; hence, DU never gets F1 Setup Response and never activates radio. In OAI, rfsimulator server side for DU becomes usable only when the radio pipeline is activated; thus it likely isn’t listening for UE yet.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE configures PHY for DL/UL at 3.6192 GHz, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106, matching DU.
- UE runs as rfsimulator client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`:
  - `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)` repeated many times.
- Interpretation: The rfsimulator server endpoint is not listening. That aligns with DU not activating radio due to missing F1 Setup Response caused by CU config failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline chain:
  1) CU hits fatal config error: unknown integrity algorithm `nia9`.
  2) CU does not accept F1 association → DU’s SCTP connect is refused.
  3) DU never activates radio → rfsimulator server is not up.
  4) UE, as client, cannot connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` (errno 111), so no RF link, no SSB, no RA, no RRC.
- Root cause: Misconfigured `security.integrity_algorithms[0] = "nia9"` in CU `gnb.conf`.
- Standards/implementation rationale:
  - 5G integrity algorithms are 128-NIA1, 128-NIA2, 128-NIA3. OAI configuration names typically use `nia1`, `nia2`, `nia3`, plus `nia0` (no integrity). `nia9` is invalid and rejected by RRC config parsing, as confirmed by the CU log.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix CU integrity algorithms to valid values and order by preference, e.g. `nia2`, `nia1`, `nia0`.
- After correction, verify:
  - CU starts without security config error.
  - DU F1AP SCTP association succeeds and F1 Setup Response is received.
  - DU activates radio; rfsimulator server listens on port 4043.
  - UE connects to rfsim, performs RA, and proceeds to RRC/NAS security.

    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Only CU `integrity_algorithms` is changed; DU and UE remain consistent with spectrum and rfsim setup.
- If your OAI build expects `nia3` naming for 128-NIA3, you can also include it and order as `["nia2", "nia1", "nia3", "nia0"]`. The essential fix is removing `nia9` and using valid identifiers.

Additional checks if issues persist after the fix:
- Confirm CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` are reachable for NGAP/GTPU if you run an AMF/UPF, though not required for rfsim bring-up.
- Ensure no firewall blocks SCTP between DU (127.0.0.3) and CU (127.0.0.5) in your environment namespace.
- Increase CU `rrc_log_level` to `debug` to confirm security capability negotiation.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps, so the exact termination behavior of CU after the security error isn’t shown; diagnosis relies on the explicit error message and DU/UE symptoms.
- UE/DU rfsimulator lifecycle specifics can vary by OAI commit; the analysis assumes server activation is gated on DU radio activation post-F1 Setup Response, which aligns with the observed connection refusals.
- The root cause is firmly supported by the provided misconfigured parameter and the CU log line indicating rejection of `nia9`.
