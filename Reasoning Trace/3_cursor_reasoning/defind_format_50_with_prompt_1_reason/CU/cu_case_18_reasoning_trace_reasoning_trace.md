## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G SA with rfsim. Evidence:
- CU cmdline shows `--rfsim --sa`; UE cmdline shows `--rfsim`, band 78, SCS 30 kHz, center frequency 3.6192 GHz.
- Control-plane signaling succeeds: NGSetup between CU and AMF, F1AP setup between CU and DU, RRC setup to RRC_CONNECTED, NAS registration accept, and PDU session setup request reaches RRC.

Expected flow: CU initializes NGAP and GTP-U; F1AP links CU↔DU; DU provides radio; UE performs PRACH→RRC→NAS registration→PDU session; CU-UP creates GTP-U N3 tunnel for user plane.

Network config summary (key fields):
- gNB CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU = 999.999.999.999` (misconfigured_param).
- gNB CU NG-AMF IPv4 = 192.168.8.43 (logs show AMF reachable; NGSetup ok). CU local_s_address for F1U = 127.0.0.5 and F1U GTP-U binds successfully.
- DU is rfsim-based, F1 toward CU at 127.0.0.5; radio config (B78, SCS 30 kHz) matches UE cmdline; PRACH/RA completes (Msg4 ACK, UE RNTI 0x706b).
- UE IMSI 001010000000001; radio parameters consistent with B78/SCS 30 kHz; UE proceeds to PDU session request.

Immediate mismatch: `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU=999.999.999.999` is not a valid IPv4 address. CU logs confirm GTP-U socket creation failure on this address. This would break CU-UP user-plane (N3), causing subsequent E1AP/CUUP issues and PDU session failure.

Assumption: AMF is reachable over NGAP via a different valid interface, so control-plane works. Only NG-U (user-plane) binding is broken due to invalid IP.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Initialization:
  - SA mode; threads for SCTP, NGAP, RRC spawned.
  - NGAP: Registered gNB, NGSetupRequest→Response successful with AMF; CU associates to AMF.
  - GTPU: "Configuring GTPu address : 999.999.999.999, port : 2152"; then "getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known", "can't create GTP-U instance", "Created gtpu instance id: -1".
  - E1AP: "Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener" (consistent with NG-U bind failure).
- Later:
  - F1AP: starts; DU connects; F1 Setup Request→Response OK; RRC setup to CONNECTED; SecurityMode, UE caps, Initial Context, PDU Session Resource Setup Request processed.
  - When attempting to set up PDU session: "try to get a gtp-u not existing output" then assertion fails in `cucp_cuup_handler.c:198 e1_bearer_context_setup()` with "Unable to create GTP Tunnel for NG-U" leading to softmodem exit.

Interpretation: Control plane succeeds, but user-plane GTP-U endpoint is not available because the NG-U local bind address is invalid. CUUP cannot create N3 tunnel; the CU-CP↔CU-UP E1 bearer setup fails and triggers an assert.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Radio/MAC: UE RNTI 706b is in-sync, BLER low, both DL/UL HARQ counters grow; PRACH CBRA succeeded ("Received Ack of Msg4").
- F1AP/SCTP: Repeated messages "SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused" and "Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3) ... retrying" appear after the CU crashes. Before the crash, F1 setup was successful as seen on the CU.

Interpretation: DU operates fine at PHY/MAC and initially establishes F1 with CU. After CU process aborts due to NG-U failure, DU’s F1 SCTP reconnect attempts are refused.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- RRC/NAS: SecurityModeComplete, UE Capability Information, Registration Accept, 5G-GUTI assigned, sends RegistrationComplete and PduSessionEstablishRequest.
- MAC stats indicate stable link and ongoing scheduling; no radio issues reported.

Interpretation: UE completes access and registration. The subsequent PDU session data-plane setup fails in the core/RAN due to CU’s NG-U bind failure, not due to UE configuration.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU binds NG-U to `999.999.999.999` → getaddrinfo failure → CUUP N3 listener not created.
  - Control plane proceeds (NGAP/F1AP/RRC) until PDU session setup requires NG-U tunnel; CU fails to create GTP-U endpoint → assertion in E1 bearer setup → CU exits.
  - DU then loses F1 connectivity and retries; UE continues to show MAC stats but user-plane cannot be established.
- Root cause: Misconfigured `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU=999.999.999.999` in CU config. This is an invalid IPv4 and prevents creating the N3 GTP-U socket, breaking CU-UP and PDU session establishment.

External knowledge: OAI CU-UP requires a valid local NG-U IPv4 address for GTP-U (port 2152). An invalid bind address yields `getaddrinfo` errors and CUUP listener failure; PDU session setup asserts when no GTP-U output exists.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix:
  - Set `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU` to a valid local IP. In this rfsim/local setup, choose the loopback address used by other CU sockets (e.g., `127.0.0.5`) or another valid interface IP reachable by the UPF/traffic sink. Ensure firewall allows UDP/2152.
  - Verify that CU-UP (integrated or split) uses the same valid IP for N3 and that routing to UPF is correct (in lab topologies, often 127.0.0.5 for local loopback testing; in containerized setups, the pod/host IP).
- Validation steps:
  - Start CU and confirm logs show "Initializing UDP for local address <valid-ip> with port 2152" without errors; E1AP CUUP listener succeeds; no "gtp-u not existing" errors during PDU session setup.
  - Observe that DU F1 remains connected after PDU session setup; UE obtains PDU session and traffic flows.

Corrected config snippets (only fields relevant to the fix are shown):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          // Changed to a valid local IP used by CU for local GTP-U
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "127.0.0.5",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152,
          // NG AMF address unchanged; control-plane already works
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43"
        },
        // Optional: keep F1U local addresses consistent with NG-U when testing locally
        "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      // No change needed for DU for this issue
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change needed for UE for this issue
    }
  }
}
```

If your UPF is external (not local loopback), set `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU` to the host interface IP that routes to the UPF, and ensure IP routing/NAT as needed.

Further analysis (if still failing):
- Check that the system has the chosen IP assigned (Windows/WSL/container vs Linux host differences). Use `ip addr` or `ifconfig`.
- Confirm UDP/2152 is free and not blocked. Use `ss -ulpn | grep 2152`.
- Verify CU-UP role is enabled and E1AP between CU-CP and CU-UP is healthy (no CUUP listener failures).

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial and without timestamps; however, they contain clear error strings directly tying failure to NG-U address resolution.
- Only one misconfiguration is analyzed; other latent issues (e.g., UPF reachability) are not verifiable from provided data.
- JSON snippets include comments for clarity; actual libconfig/JSON consumers may not accept comments—apply the key changes in your real config format accordingly.
