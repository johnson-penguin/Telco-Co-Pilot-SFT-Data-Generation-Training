## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- Scenario: OAI NR SA over RFsim. Logs show `--rfsim --sa`. Architecture is CU/DU split over F1; UE is RFsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU init → F1C listens → DU init → F1AP SCTP assoc → DU activates radio/time source (RFsim server) → UE TCP connects → SSB detect → PRACH → RRC attach → NAS/PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter: `security.ciphering_algorithms[0]=nea9` (invalid/unknown). OAI supports `nea0`, `nea1`, `nea2`, `nea3`.
- Network config highlights:
  - CU: `tracking_area_code=1`, PLMN 1/1, F1-C at 127.0.0.5:501, F1-U 2152, AMF 192.168.70.132, `security.ciphering_algorithms = ["nea9","nea2","nea1","nea0"]`.
  - DU: TAC 1 (matches CU), n78, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs, PRACH index 98, TDD pattern consistent, RFsim server mode: port 4043.
  - UE: SIM/DNN only; defaults to RFsim client 127.0.0.1:4043 per logs.
- Initial mismatch: CU declares an unknown ciphering algorithm (`nea9`) which triggers an RRC/config error and likely prevents CU from reaching an operational F1C listening state; DU cannot complete F1AP; UE cannot connect to RFsim because DU defers radio activation without F1 Setup.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU boot messages: SA mode, build info; F1AP identifiers printed (id/name), SDAP disabled, DRB count.
- Critical error: `[RRC]   unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9" in section "security" of the configuration file`.
  - This indicates CU rejects the configured preferred cipher. In OAI, the `security.ciphering_algorithms` array is parsed and validated; an unknown first entry can cause a config error and may block further RRC setup and/or overall init.
- Post-error, only config-reading traces are present; there’s no confirmation of NGAP/F1 servers initialized. No log shows F1C listener creation on CU.
- Conclusion: CU fails to reach F1C operational state due to invalid security algorithm configuration.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU PHY/MAC init completes, ServingCellConfigCommon parsed, TDD configured, RU prepared.
- F1AP client attempts: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` followed by repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and retries.
- DU prints `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → DU defers RFsim server activation until F1 Setup succeeds.
- Therefore, DU stays in a pre-activation state because CU is not accepting F1C connections.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE configures PHY for n78 106 PRBs, starts as RFsim client.
- Repeated `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)` → DU hasn’t activated RFsim server (blocked by missing F1 Setup), so TCP connection is refused.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Chain of events:
  - CU parses config and encounters unknown `nea9` cipher → security config error → CU does not fully initialize F1C/NGAP.
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP association to CU (connection refused) and waits for F1 Setup → radio not activated; RFsim server not listening.
  - UE RFsim client cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 → repeated failures.
- Root cause: Invalid CU `security.ciphering_algorithms[0]` set to `nea9` (unsupported). This blocks proper CU initialization and cascades to DU (F1AP down) and UE (RFsim server unavailable).
- Standards and OAI behavior:
  - 3GPP defines NEA0/1/2; NEA3 is also supported by OAI. `nea9` is not a valid identifier in OAI; OAI explicitly validates known names and logs an error for unknown values.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix configuration on CU:
  - Replace `nea9` with a supported algorithm at the head of the list, e.g., `nea3` (or `nea2`). Ensure integrity list remains valid (`nia2`, `nia0`).
- After change, expected behavior:
  - CU should complete security config, start F1C/NGAP; DU SCTP association should succeed; DU will activate radio and RFsim server at 4043; UE will connect, detect SSB, perform PRACH, and proceed with RRC/NAS.
- Corrected configuration snippets (JSON within the provided structure):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": [
          "nea3",  // CHANGED: was "nea9" (unsupported). Use one of: nea3, nea2, nea1, nea0
          "nea2",
          "nea1",
          "nea0"
        ],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "tracking_area_code": 1  // unchanged; already aligned with CU
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- Additional checks and tools:
  - Verify CU logs show F1C listening (SCTP server bind) and NGAP connection attempts to AMF.
  - If issues persist, enable higher `rrc_log_level`/`ngap_log_level` and confirm security capability negotiation (UE/CU) shows matching NEA/NIA sets.

## 7. Limitations
- CU logs are truncated post-error; we infer CU does not proceed to bind F1C/NGAP from DU connection refusals.
- No absolute timestamps; correlation is based on typical OAI init order and repeated connect-refused patterns.
- The precise behavior on unknown cipher in a given OAI commit can vary (fatal vs. soft error), but observed DU connection failures strongly indicate CU wasn’t listening on F1C.
