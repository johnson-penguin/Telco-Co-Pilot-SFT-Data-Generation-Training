## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The logs show SA mode with `--rfsim` for CU, DU, and UE. Expected flow: CU initializes NGAP toward AMF and exposes F1-C/F1-U; DU initializes PHY/MAC and connects to CU over F1; UE connects to DU via rfsim, then RRC attach and PDU session.
- The provided misconfiguration is **`gNBs.local_s_address=invalid_ip_format`** in the CU config. In OAI split F1 (CU/DU), `local_s_address` is the CU’s local IP used for F1-C SCTP and F1-U UDP endpoints, and must match the DU’s `remote_n_address`/`remote_s_address`.
- From `network_config`:
  - `cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address` = "invalid_ip_format" (erroneous), `remote_s_address` = `127.0.0.3`. CU NG/NGU toward core uses `192.168.8.43`.
  - `du_conf.MACRLCs[0]`: `local_n_address` = `127.0.0.3`, `remote_n_address` = `127.0.0.5`. DU expects CU at `127.0.0.5` for F1-C and F1-U.
  - UE config contains SIM credentials only; RF/rfsim details are default.
- Immediate mismatch: CU `local_s_address` is not a valid IP string and does not match the DU’s expected CU address (`127.0.0.5`). This should break F1 setup and any F1-U listener creation at the CU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU brings up NGAP successfully to AMF (`Send NGSetupRequest` → `Received NGSetupResponse`). GTP-U for NGU initially uses `192.168.8.43` as expected.
- Critical failures tied to `local_s_address`:
  - `F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for invalid_ip_format` → indicates F1-C address resolution attempts with an invalid hostname/IP.
  - `GTPU Initializing UDP for local address invalid_ip_format with port 2152` → CU attempts to bind F1-U (CU side) using the same invalid address.
  - `getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known` → address resolution fails.
  - Assertion: `getCxt(instance)->gtpInst > 0` in `f1ap_cu_task.c:126` → CU aborts due to failure to create F1-U listener; message: `Failed to create CU F1-U UDP listener` then `Exiting execution`.
- Conclusion for CU: CU process exits before F1 setup completes due to invalid `local_s_address`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes L1/MAC correctly, configures TDD and RF parameters, then starts F1AP:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 127.0.0.3`.
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with automatic retries.
  - `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` persists.
- The DU is healthy but cannot connect because the CU is down/crashed; its `remote_n_address` is 127.0.0.5, but nothing listens there due to CU exit.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE configures RF and attempts to connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly, failing with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- In rfsim, the DU acts as the server when up; since DU never activates radio (blocked on F1 Setup Response), the rfsim server is not listening, hence UE connection failures.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU fails early due to invalid F1 local address, aborts execution → F1 not available.
  - DU retries SCTP to CU at `127.0.0.5` and never succeeds → remains waiting, never activates radio/rfsim server.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` → repeated refusals.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured parameter: **Invalid `cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address` value (`invalid_ip_format`)**. It must be a valid IP address reachable by the DU and consistent with DU’s `remote_n_address`. The DU expects the CU at `127.0.0.5`; therefore CU should set `local_s_address=127.0.0.5` (loopback topology) or another resolvable IP that the DU targets.
- Secondary observation: CU logs show both NGU `192.168.8.43` and F1-U attempting `invalid_ip_format`; OAI uses separate address blocks: NGU/NG-AMF use `NETWORK_INTERFACES`, F1 uses `local_s_*`/`remote_s_*`. Mixing them is fine as long as each is valid. Here only the F1 address is invalid.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Config fixes:
  - Set CU `local_s_address` to a valid IP that matches DU’s `remote_n_address` (and DU’s `remote_s_address` if present). For this topology: `127.0.0.5`.
  - Ensure DU `remote_n_address` points to the same IP (`127.0.0.5`) and DU `local_n_address` (`127.0.0.3`) matches CU `remote_s_address` (`127.0.0.3`) — already consistent.
  - Keep NGU/NG-AMF addresses as configured (`192.168.8.43`) unless your routing requires otherwise.

- Sanity checks after change:
  - `ping 127.0.0.5` and `ping 127.0.0.3` (loopback aliases or appropriate routing) if using network namespaces; otherwise verify interface binding succeeds without DNS resolution.
  - Start CU → confirm no `getaddrinfo` errors; F1AP starts and listens; DU connects; then rfsim server appears and UE connects.

- Optional hardening:
  - Use explicit IPs (avoid hostnames) for F1 in lab setups to bypass DNS.
  - If using multiple loopback IPs, ensure the OS/network namespace is configured to accept binds to those IPs (e.g., add aliases to `lo`).
  - Monitor with `ss -lpn | egrep '2152|500|501'` on CU/DU to confirm listeners/associations.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and without explicit timestamps, but show clear fatal assertion at CU and repeated SCTP failures at DU, sufficient to attribute the failure to the invalid CU F1 local address.
- No need for spec deep-dive here because the fault is transport-layer address binding/resolution, not PHY/MAC/RRC semantics. If F1 proceeded but PRACH failed, we would pivot to 38.211/38.331 and DU PHY logs.

—
Root cause: invalid CU `local_s_address` broke F1 listener creation, cascading to DU SCTP connection refusals and UE rfsim connect failures. Fix by setting a valid CU F1 local IP (e.g., `127.0.0.5`) consistent with DU’s expectations.
