### 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Scenario**: OAI 5G NR SA with RF simulator. CU and DU start successfully; UE runs as RFsim client. Expected flow: CU NGAP setup with AMF → F1AP setup CU↔DU → DU broadcasts SIB1 → UE connects to RFsim server, synchronizes, performs PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.
- **Key clue (given)**: misconfigured `gNBs.plmn_list.mcc=999` on CU.
- **Configs parsed**:
  - **CU `gnb_conf`**: `plmn_list.mcc=999`, `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2` → PLMN 999-01. F1 CU address `127.0.0.5`, DU peer `127.0.0.3`. NG/NGU IPs `192.168.8.43`.
  - **DU `gnb_conf`**: PLMN list entry `mcc=1`, `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2` → PLMN 001-01. NR cell, band n78, TDD, PRACH index 98 (consistent). F1 DU address `127.0.0.3` and CU peer `127.0.0.5`.
  - **UE `ue_conf`**: IMSI `001010000000001` → Home PLMN 001-01.
- **Initial mismatch**: CU advertises PLMN 999-01, while DU and UE use 001-01. This is expected to break F1 Setup (PLMN must match across CU and DU) and later UE selection.

### 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU runs SA, initializes NG/GTPU, sends NGSetup to AMF. There is a transient NG setup failure then a success, so NG is up.
- CU receives F1 Setup Request from DU and immediately logs: "PLMN mismatch: CU 999.01, DU 00101" followed by SCTP shutdown and F1 endpoint removal. CU reports no DU connected. This indicates CU rejects F1 Setup due to PLMN mismatch derived from SIB1/ServCellConfigCommon vs CU PLMN config.
- Cross-ref: CU `plmn_list` is 999-01, matching the log.

### 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly for n78 TDD, PRACH, SIB1 parameters; F1 client tries to connect to CU.
- DU logs: "the CU reported F1AP Setup Failure, is there a configuration mismatch?" Exactly when CU logged PLMN mismatch. No PHY/MAC asserts; the failure is at F1AP layer due to configuration disagreement, not radio.
- PLMN on DU is 001-01, consistent with SIB1 and `servingCellConfigCommon` and with the UE IMSI.

### 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE fully initializes RF front-end and then repeatedly attempts to connect RFsim to `127.0.0.1:4043` but gets `errno(111)` (connection refused) in a loop.
- Reason: DU shuts down F1 association after CU rejection and therefore does not host RFsim server, so UE cannot attach at all. This is a secondary symptom caused by the CU–DU PLMN mismatch.

### 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU NGAP ok → DU initiates F1 Setup → CU rejects with PLMN mismatch (999-01 vs 001-01) → DU reports F1AP Setup Failure → RFsim server not available → UE TCP connection refused.
- Given misconfigured parameter `gNBs.plmn_list.mcc=999` on CU, the root cause is a PLMN inconsistency between CU and DU/UE. OAI validates PLMN alignment during F1 Setup; mismatch causes `F1 Setup Failure` and SCTP shutdown.
- 3GPP/implementation rationale: Although 3GPP allows multiple PLMNs per cell, CU and DU must agree on the configured broadcast PLMN(s) in SIB1/NG setup context. OAI enforces equality for single-PLMN deployments; a different MCC at CU makes the CU reject DU’s SIB1 PLMN set.

### 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- **Fix**: Align CU PLMN with DU/UE. Change CU `plmn_list.mcc` from 999 to 1 (PLMN 001-01). Ensure `mnc_length=2` remains.
- Optional sanity checks:
  - Verify AMF is configured to accept `001-01` and UE IMSI `001010...`.
  - Keep DU/UE unchanged; their PLMN is already aligned.
  - After change: expect F1 Setup success, DU stays up, RFsim server listens on 4043, UE connects and proceeds to cell search and attach.

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "plmn_list": {
          "mcc": 1,            // changed from 999 to match DU/UE (001)
          "mnc": 1,
          "mnc_length": 2,
          "snssaiList": { "sst": 1 }
        }
      }
    },
    "du_conf": { /* no change */ },
    "ue_conf": { /* no change */ }
  }
}
```

- If issues persist after alignment:
  - Capture CU F1AP and RRC logs at debug level to confirm SIB1 PLMN set.
  - Confirm no duplicate TAC/NR Cell ID inconsistencies.
  - Validate that CU and DU both list the same PLMN set if multiple PLMNs are used.

### 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; NG setup shows a brief failure then success which is unusual but not central to the root cause.
- Assumed single-PLMN deployment; multi-PLMN requires consistent sets across CU and DU which is not shown here.
- The analysis relies on OAI’s F1 Setup validation behavior and the provided misconfigured parameter; deeper 3GPP citations are not necessary for this config-level mismatch.
