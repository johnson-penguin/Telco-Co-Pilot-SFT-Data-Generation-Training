## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs indicate an OAI 5G NR Standalone (SA) deployment using rfsimulator with a functional split between CU and DU over F1. The CU successfully initializes NGAP and reaches NGSetupResponse with AMF, while the DU repeatedly fails to establish the F1 SCTP association to the CU and therefore never activates radio. The UE repeatedly fails to connect to the rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 because the DU’s rfsimulator server is not active prior to F1 setup completion.

Network configuration parsing (key fields only):
- CU (`cu_conf.gNBs`): `tr_s_preference="invalid_preference"`, `local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address=127.0.0.3`, F1 ports `local_s_portc=501`, `remote_s_portc=500`. NGU/NG-AP IPs: `192.168.8.43`.
- DU (`du_conf.MACRLCs[0]`): `tr_s_preference="local_L1"`, `tr_n_preference="f1"`, `local_n_address=127.0.0.3`, `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5`, `local_n_portc=500`, `remote_n_portc=501`.
- DU serving cell: SCS µ=1, `N_RB=106`, band n78, `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280` (3.6192 GHz), TDD pattern present; PRACH parameters appear valid (e.g., `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98`).
- UE: IMSI/dnn provided; RF settings consistent with DU (3.6192 GHz, µ=1, N_RB=106). UE connects as rfsimulator client to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Immediate red flag: the misconfigured parameter `gNBs.tr_s_preference=invalid_preference` in the CU config. In OAI, `tr_s_preference` controls the transport split; invalid values typically prevent proper initialization of F1 endpoints/tasks on the CU side. This aligns with the DU’s persistent SCTP connection refusals.

Expected SA flow: process startup → CU NGAP setup with AMF → DU F1-C association to CU → F1 Setup → DU radio activation → UE RF connect to rfsim → PRACH/RACH → RRC attach and PDU session. The flow stalls at “DU F1-C association to CU”.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA mode; NGAP threads are created; GTP-U initialized for SA; AMF registration proceeds and `NGSetupResponse` is received.
- No evidence of F1 task/listener initialization in CU logs (no F1AP server bind/listen lines). For a CU, we would expect logs around F1-C server setup (SCTP listen on `local_s_address:local_s_portc`).
- CU network settings: `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/NGU=192.168.8.43` match the CU’s NG interfaces and explain why NGAP/GTPC succeed.
- The absence of any F1AP listener logs strongly suggests the CU did not instantiate the F1 server, consistent with an invalid `tr_s_preference` value.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC, parses ServingCellConfigCommon, sets TDD pattern and RF frequencies. No PHY assertion/errors (PRACH, SIB, numerology) are present.
- DU attempts F1AP: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`, then repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by retries.
- DU waits: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`, so rfsimulator server is not started/serving samples to UE.
- Conclusion: DU is healthy but cannot connect to CU F1-C endpoint. The CU likely isn’t listening on 127.0.0.5:501 due to misconfigured split preference.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config matches DU RF (3.6192 GHz, µ=1, N_RB=106). It tries to connect as rfsimulator client to 127.0.0.1:4043 and repeatedly gets `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- This is a downstream effect of the DU not reaching “radio active” state without F1 Setup; the DU’s rfsimulator server doesn’t accept connections, so the UE cannot attach.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation: CU reaches AMF; DU initializes but F1-C connect to CU fails (connection refused); DU remains inactive; UE cannot connect to rfsim server. All failures hinge on the CU not providing an F1-C server.
- Misconfigured parameter: `cu_conf.gNBs.tr_s_preference=invalid_preference`.
  - In OAI, valid values include options like `f1` (for CU/DU split), `local_L1` (monolithic), etc., depending on component role. An invalid value prevents the CU from enabling the proper split and launching F1AP server tasks.
  - Because the CU isn’t listening on `127.0.0.5:501`, the DU’s SCTP connect is refused, and consequently the DU never activates radio and the rfsim server never accepts UE connections.
- Therefore, the root cause is the invalid CU `tr_s_preference`, which blocks F1 server initialization and cascades to DU/UE failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Set `cu_conf.gNBs.tr_s_preference` to a valid value matching a CU role in split architecture, e.g., `"f1"`.
- Ensure address/port symmetry is correct (it already is): CU `local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, DU `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5`; CU `local_s_portc=501`, DU `remote_n_portc=501`; DU `local_n_portc=500`, CU `remote_s_portc=500`.

Suggested corrected snippets (JSON with inline comments for clarity):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "tr_s_preference": "f1" // fixed: was "invalid_preference"; enables CU F1 server
    }
  },
  "du_conf": {
    "MACRLCs": [
      {
        "tr_s_preference": "local_L1", // OK for DU side
        "tr_n_preference": "f1",       // DU uses F1 towards CU
        "local_n_address": "127.0.0.3",
        "remote_n_address": "127.0.0.5",
        "local_n_portc": 500,
        "remote_n_portc": 501
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Operational checks after change:
- On CU logs, confirm F1AP server bind/listen on 127.0.0.5:501.
- On DU logs, confirm SCTP association established and `F1 Setup Response` received; then DU radio activation.
- On UE logs, confirm successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and subsequent RACH/RRC procedures.

If still issues:
- Verify no firewalls block 127.0.0.5:501/127.0.0.3:500 on the host namespace.
- Confirm CU is launched as CU role binary/mode and not monolithic gNB.
- Increase F1AP/NGAP log levels to `debug` for more visibility.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not explicitly display CU F1 server initialization lines, but the consistent DU `connection refused` and known OAI behavior with invalid `tr_s_preference` strongly support the diagnosis.
- No ASN.1/PHY errors present; the issue is transport-layer CU/DU split configuration.
- The recommendation is based on OAI split configuration conventions; exact accepted strings may vary slightly with OAI version—use the CU example configs for authoritative valid `tr_s_preference` values (commonly `f1`).
