## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- Deployment appears to be OAI NR SA with RF simulator: CU and DU launched separately (F1 split), UE in rfsim client mode.
- Expected call flow: CU initializes NGAP and binds toward AMF → DU establishes F1-C toward CU → DU activates radio (rfsim server) → UE connects via rfsim to DU → RACH/RA, RRC, NGAP, PDU Session.
- Key clue from misconfigured_param: gNB NG interface IP is set to an invalid IPv4 string `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=999.999.999.999`.
- Network config summary (relevant):
  - CU `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF`: 999.999.999.999 (invalid)
  - CU `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4`: 192.168.70.132 (likely correct AMF destination)
  - CU `gNBs.local_s_address`: 127.0.0.5; DU `MACRLCs.remote_n_address`: 127.0.0.5 (F1-C target)
  - DU rfsim server on port 4043; UE tries 127.0.0.1:4043
- Immediate mismatch: CU log shows it parsed the NG AMF IP as `999.999.999.999` and then crashes in SCTP address resolution. This prevents CU from accepting F1 from DU and, in turn, DU never starts radio and rfsim server remains unavailable to UE.

Why this matters: OAI needs a valid IP to either bind local NG interface and/or contact AMF; an invalid IPv4 string causes `getaddrinfo()` failure and an assertion in SCTP setup.

---

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode and initializes NGAP/GTPU/F1AP threads.
- Critical lines:
  - "Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 999.999.999.999"
  - Assertion failure in `sctp_handle_new_association_req()` with `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999) failed: Name or service not known` followed by exit.
- Interpretation:
  - The CU attempts to resolve or use `999.999.999.999` as an address for NG (AMF side). `getaddrinfo()` rejects this invalid IPv4. OAI asserts and exits.
  - After the crash, we still see log tail fragments, but the essential point is CU is not running to accept DU F1-C connections.
- Cross-reference with config:
  - Although `amf_ip_address.ipv4` is set to 192.168.70.132, the CU log reveals that the stack is using the `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` value as the NG AMF address (in this build/config precedence), or at least passes it into `getaddrinfo()` during SCTP setup for NG.
  - Therefore, the invalid value directly causes CU NGAP initialization failure.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC and F1 tasks, then tries to connect to CU at 127.0.0.5.
- Repeated errors:
  - "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused"
  - "[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying..."
  - "[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio"
- Interpretation:
  - DU cannot establish F1-C because CU has crashed from NGAP setup; without an accepting SCTP endpoint at the CU, DU gets ECONNREFUSED and keeps retrying.
  - Because F1 Setup never completes, DU keeps radio deactivated; rfsim server side won’t be ready.
- Config linkage:
  - DU targets CU `remote_n_address` 127.0.0.5 which matches CU `local_s_address` 127.0.0.5; addresses themselves are fine. The failure is upstream: CU is down due to NG misconfiguration.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE configures RF chains and repeatedly tries to connect to rfsim server:
  - "Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043" → "connect() ... failed, errno(111)" repeating.
- Interpretation:
  - The rfsim server is supposed to be hosted by the DU when radio is activated. Since DU is blocked waiting for F1 Setup Response, the rfsim server is not ready, leading to UE connection failures.
- Config linkage:
  - DU `rfsimulator.serverport` is 4043 and the model is AWGN; UE attempts 127.0.0.1:4043 which is consistent for local rfsim setups. The root cause remains CU-side crash preventing DU activation.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU attempts NGAP/SCTP init → crashes on invalid NG address `999.999.999.999`.
  - DU repeatedly fails F1-C to CU with connection refused because CU isn't alive.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim port because DU never activates radio without F1 Setup.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param):
  - Misconfigured `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` set to an impossible IPv4 leads to `getaddrinfo()` failure in SCTP setup for NG. CU aborts, blocking the entire chain.
- Spec and OAI behavior notes:
  - While 3GPP doesn’t dictate implementation details for IP parsing, OAI expects a valid IPv4 for NG interface and/or AMF destination depending on configuration precedence. Invalid literals cause immediate init failures.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Primary fix options (choose based on your intended semantics):
  - If the field is intended as the AMF destination address in your build/config: set `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` to the real AMF IP `192.168.70.132`.
  - If the field is intended as the local bind (gNB NG interface) while the AMF destination is `amf_ip_address.ipv4`: set `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` to a valid local interface address on the NG network (e.g., `192.168.8.43`), and keep `amf_ip_address.ipv4` as `192.168.70.132`.
- Given the CU log string "Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 999.999.999.999", your current stack is clearly consuming this field as the AMF endpoint. Therefore, set it to `192.168.70.132` to align with the known AMF IP.
- After fix, validate:
  - CU starts without SCTP assertion; NGAP connects to AMF.
  - DU F1 Setup completes; DU activates radio and rfsim server.
  - UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043 successfully, proceeds with RACH/RRC/NGAP attach and PDU session.

Corrected config snippets (JSON with comments explaining changes):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "amf_ip_address": {
          "ipv4": "192.168.70.132"
        },
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          // CHANGED: was "999.999.999.999" causing getaddrinfo() failure
          // Set to actual AMF destination used by this build (per logs)
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.70.132",
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        }
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      // No change required for F1; DU will succeed once CU is up
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server",
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No changes needed; UE will connect once DU activates the rfsim server
      "uicc0": {
        "imsi": "001010000000001",
        "dnn": "oai",
        "nssai_sst": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If instead your deployment expects `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` to be the local bind (and the stack to always use `amf_ip_address` as AMF destination), use this alternative CU snippet:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "amf_ip_address": { "ipv4": "192.168.70.132" },
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          // CHANGED: set to valid local IP of CU on NG network
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after applying either fix:
- Confirm CU can resolve/bind the configured IP (use `ip addr` on host).
- Ensure AMF is reachable (ping `192.168.70.132`, check firewalls, SCTP 38412 open if applicable).
- Observe CU logs: NGAP connected, no SCTP assertions.
- Observe DU logs: F1 Setup Request/Response succeeds; radio activation log appears; rfsim server starts.
- Observe UE logs: TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds; UE proceeds to RRC and NGAP.

---

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial and lack timestamps; precise ordering inferred from typical OAI behavior.
- The CU build appears to prioritize `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` for NG address resolution per the log string; in other OAI releases the precedence may differ. The provided two fix paths cover both interpretations.
- No external spec lookup needed; failure is at IP parsing/binding layer before 3GPP procedures begin.
