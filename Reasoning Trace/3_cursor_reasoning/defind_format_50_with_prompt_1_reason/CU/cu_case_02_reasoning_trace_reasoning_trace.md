## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
This is an OAI 5G NR Standalone deployment using the RF simulator (rfsim). Components and expected flow:
- CU starts in SA with F1-C toward the DU → validates configuration → NGAP toward AMF → awaits F1 Setup from DU.
- DU initializes PHY/MAC, configures TDD and carriers, starts F1-C association to CU → upon success, activates radio and the rfsim server.
- UE runs as rfsim client connecting to the DU’s rfsim server (TCP 4043) → synchronizes to SSB → performs PRACH/RA → RRC setup → NAS registration and PDU session.

Provided misconfiguration: misconfigured_param = "gNBs.tracking_area_code=65535" (on CU). OAI validates TAC at startup; out-of-range values cause immediate termination before F1/NGAP bring-up.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs.tracking_area_code = 65535 (invalid; log confirms rejection, allowed [1..65533]).
- du_conf.gNBs[0].tracking_area_code = 1 (valid).
- F1 endpoints: CU `127.0.0.5` ↔ DU `127.0.0.3`. rfsimulator server: DU mode on port 4043; UE attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- RF/numerology coherent across DU/UE: n78, μ=1, N_RB=106, DL/UL 3619.2 MHz.

Initial mismatch guided by the misconfigured_param: CU exits due to invalid TAC 65535, so CU is absent; DU cannot establish F1; UE cannot connect to rfsim server (connection refused) because DU never becomes operational.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode and build info print, then config validator emits: "tracking_area_code: 65535 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533"; followed by "section gNBs.[0] ... wrong value" and "Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun".
- No NGAP, F1AP, or GTP-U initialization proceeds; the process terminates at configuration check.
- Corroborates cu_conf: `tracking_area_code` is indeed 65535.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC, sets TDD pattern, frequencies (3619200000 Hz), μ=1, N_RB=106; no PHY/MAC errors.
- DU starts F1AP and attempts SCTP connect to CU: repeated "Connect failed: Connection refused"; F1AP retries and DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
- Because CU exited on config error, nothing listens on CU 127.0.0.5: F1-C cannot be established; DU never transitions to an active cell nor exposes a stable rfsim server.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config matches DU numerology and carrier. It runs as an rfsim client and repeatedly attempts TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- All attempts fail with errno(111) Connection refused, which is consistent with the DU not running a server due to the failed F1 association (rooted in CU exit).
- No SSB sync, PRACH, or RRC signaling occurs because the physical link to a DU server is absent.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation: CU exits immediately during configuration validation (invalid TAC 65535) → DU attempts F1-C to CU but gets SCTP refused → DU does not activate radio nor rfsim server → UE TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 is refused repeatedly.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): CU `gNBs.tracking_area_code=65535` is out of the allowed range [1..65533] in OAI (and 3GPP semantics reserve upper values). OAI aborts early, cascading into DU/UE failures.
- Spec/code context: TAC is defined per 3GPP (e.g., TS 23.003); OAI’s validator enforces a bounded integer range and rejects 65535. Because CU termination precedes F1 and NGAP establishment, all subsequent procedures are blocked.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix: Set CU `gNBs.tracking_area_code` to a valid value; align with DU’s `1` for consistency.
- After change: CU passes config checks → DU establishes F1 (Setup → Response/Complete) → DU activates radio and rfsim server (port 4043) → UE connects and proceeds with RA/RRC/NAS.

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "tracking_area_code": 1 // CHANGED from 65535 → 1 (valid range [1..65533])
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "tracking_area_code": 1 // unchanged; matches CU for F1/PLMN/TAC coherence
        }
      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "uicc0": {
        "imsi": "001010000000001" // unchanged; matches PLMN 001/01 commonly used in OAI
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Verification checklist after applying the fix:
- Start CU: no config errors; observe NG setup toward AMF if configured; F1AP listening.
- Start DU: SCTP association established (no more "Connection refused"); F1 Setup completes; DU reports SIB1 scheduling and "activating radio".
- UE: TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds; observe SSB sync, PRACH (Msg1/Msg2/Msg3), RRC Setup Complete, and NAS Registration Accept.
- Optional: Increase log levels (`Asn1_verbosity`, F1AP/NGAP) if further diagnosis is needed.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; sequence inferred from typical OAI startup and explicit error lines.
- AMF acceptance of PLMN is assumed consistent with defaults; if NGAP issues remain post-fix, verify AMF PLMN/TAC support.
- No additional spec lookup was necessary because the CU log explicitly states the accepted TAC range, matching common OAI constraints.
