## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

Scenario: OAI 5G NR Standalone with RF simulator. CU runs with `--rfsim --sa` and F1 split (`tr_s_preference: f1`), DU provides NR L1/MAC/PHY and rfsimulator server at port 4043, UE is an RFsim client trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Expected call flow:
- CU starts → validates config → starts F1-C server (SCTP) and NGAP towards AMF.
- DU starts → connects F1-C to CU → activates radio → broadcasts SSB/SIB1 → PRACH → RRC connection → PDU session.
- UE starts → connects to rfsim server (DU) → detects SSB → PRACH → RRC setup.

Given misconfigured_param: `gNBs.plmn_list.snssaiList.sst=256` (in CU config). 3GPP 5QI/S-NSSAI `sst` is 8-bit and must be in [0..255]. Value 256 is invalid. OAI config layer validates parameter ranges on startup.

Network config quick parse:
- cu_conf.gNBs.plmn_list: mcc/mnc (1/1), `snssaiList.sst=256` (invalid), CU F1C addr `127.0.0.5` toward DU `127.0.0.3`, NGU/S1U 2152, AMF ipv4 192.168.70.132, NG interface IPs 192.168.8.43.
- du_conf.gNBs[0].plmn_list[0].snssaiList[0]: `sst=1, sd=0x010203` (valid). Serving cell numerology µ=1, DL BW 106 PRB, band n78, PRACH index 98, TDD pattern consistent with logs. rfsimulator serveraddr: "server" with port 4043 (OAI interprets "server" mode to bind and accept connections). DU F1C connects to CU at `127.0.0.5`.
- ue_conf.uicc0: `nssai_sst=1`, IMSI 001010..., DNN oai, keys set.

Initial mismatch: CU `sst=256` invalid; DU and UE expect `sst=1`. This should cause CU to abort during config check before bringing up F1C, cascading to DU F1 SCTP connection refusals and UE rfsim connection failures.

High-probability issue focus: Config layer validation failure at CU due to invalid `sst`, preventing CU startup.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU confirms SA mode and shows build info.
- Early RAN context shows no MAC/L1 instances (as expected for CU only): `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0`.
- Critical line: `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: sst: 256 invalid value, authorized range: 0 255`.
- Immediately followed by: `[ENB_APP] [CONFIG] ... snssaiList.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` and `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- No NGAP or F1AP startup appears after validation; thus CU exits before opening SCTP listener for F1-C at 127.0.0.5:500.

Cross-reference with cu_conf: `plmn_list.snssaiList.sst` indeed 256. This matches the validator complaint and explains early exit.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC, configures TDD, band n78, numerology µ=1, SIB1/TDD consistent with du_conf.
- DU attempts F1-C SCTP to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` with F1AP retries and `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- This indicates no SCTP listener at CU side, consistent with CU having exited due to config error.

Link to gNB params: Nothing else in DU suggests PHY/PRACH issues; the stall is purely F1-C connectivity blocked by CU being down.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE configures RF chains and attempts to connect to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Repeated `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)` (connection refused). In OAI rfsim, the DU in server mode should bind 4043; but DU defers radio activation and (commonly) rfsim bring-up can be tied to successful F1 setup, or the process is simply not accepting because the DU is not fully active.
- Since DU is stuck waiting for F1 Setup Response, the rfsim server isn't accepting the UE connection, leading to the repeated failures.

UE’s `nssai_sst=1` is consistent with DU; it would have been fine once the CU/DU were up.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline: CU exits immediately on invalid `sst` → DU cannot establish F1-C to CU (connection refused) → DU remains in pre-activation state → UE cannot connect to rfsim server (connection refused).
- Root cause guided by misconfigured_param: `sst=256` is out of 8-bit range. 3GPP S-NSSAI SST is 8 bits [0..255]; OAI enforces this range at startup. Because CU is the F1-C server endpoint and NGAP anchor, its exit blocks the system.
- No evidence of PHY/PRACH issues; all anomalies are consistent with control-plane bootstrap failure from CU exit.

External knowledge note: Per 3GPP (S-NSSAI definition in 23.501/24.501), SST is 1 octet; OAI config layer validates bounds and aborts on violation.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fix:
- Set CU `plmn_list.snssaiList.sst` to a valid value that matches DU and UE, e.g., `1`.

Post-fix validation steps:
- Start CU; confirm no `[CONFIG] ... invalid value` lines; observe F1AP server listening and NGAP connection to AMF.
- Start DU; verify F1-C connects (no SCTP refused), F1 Setup completes, radio activates, SSB/SIB1 transmitted.
- Start UE; verify rfsim connects, SSB detection, PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session.

Optional robustness checks:
- Ensure CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` IPs match the host; confirm AMF IP reachability (192.168.70.132) or use loopback test AMF if applicable.
- Align S-NSSAI across CU/DU/UE (`sst` and optional `sd`). If UE requests `sst=1`, configure CU slice to include `sst=1`.

    "cu_conf": {

          "snssaiList": {
            "sst": 1
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "plmn_list": [
            {
              "mcc": 1,
              "mnc": 1,
              "mnc_length": 2,
              "snssaiList": [
                { "sst": 1, "sd": "0x010203" }
              ]

      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "uicc0": { "nssai_sst": 1 }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Set CU `sst` to 1 to match DU/UE; no other changes are strictly required for this error case.
- If also using SD selection, consider adding CU slice SD `0x010203` to match DU and UE policies.

Further analysis if issues persist after fix:
- If DU still holds rfsim until F1 completes, ensure CU is fully up and F1 Setup completes (check F1AP logs on both sides).
- Verify SCTP ports: CU `local_s_portc=501` vs DU `remote_n_portc=501`/`local_n_portc=500` are consistent; IPs `127.0.0.5` (CU) and `127.0.0.3` (DU) align in both configs.
- Confirm AMF reachability and proper NGAP registration; otherwise UE may attach but fail PDU session.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; we infer sequencing from message order.
- We did not validate AMF connectivity beyond config values; potential external network issues are out of scope here.
- rfsimulator acceptance behavior can vary with build; the repeated connection refused is explained by DU pre-activation, but exact coupling to F1 setup may differ slightly across commits.
