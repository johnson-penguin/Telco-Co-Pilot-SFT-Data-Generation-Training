## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- This is an OAI 5G NR Standalone deployment using rfsimulator. Evidence:
  - CU command line shows `--rfsim --sa`.
  - DU/UE logs show TDD Band n78 at 3619.2 MHz and rfsimulator activity.
- Expected SA control-plane/data-plane flow:
  1) CU parses config and starts NGAP towards AMF, opens F1-C for DU.
  2) DU initializes PHY/MAC, opens F1-C towards CU, waits for F1-Setup.
  3) DU activates radio (rfsimulator server) after F1 setup.
  4) UE connects to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043, proceeds to cell search → PRACH → RRC setup → PDU session.

- Provided misconfigured parameter: **`gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=999.999.999.999`** (invalid IPv4). This would break CU ↔ AMF NGAP connectivity even if the CU started. In the current logs, the CU actually fails earlier due to a config parsing error, preventing F1-C establishment and radio activation.

- Parse key `network_config` parameters and initial mismatches:
  - `cu_conf.gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` is `"192.168.8.43"`. This differs in naming from the misconfigured line (`gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4`) and suggests the user’s original `.conf` may have an incorrect/legacy key plus an invalid IP value on that line (line 91), causing the CU config parse failure seen in CU logs.
  - `cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address=127.0.0.5` and `du_conf.MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=127.0.0.3` match DU log F1-C endpoints (`F1-C DU 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5`). So F1 addressing is correct.
  - `du_conf.rfsimulator.serveraddr="server"` means DU acts as rfsim server. UE tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly, failing with `errno(111)` because DU never activates the radio while waiting for F1-Setup.

Conclusion of context: The CU fails to start because of a syntax error on/near the misconfigured AMF IP line. As a result, DU cannot complete F1 setup (connection refused), and UE cannot connect to the rfsim server (not up). Even if the syntax parsed, the value `999.999.999.999` is an invalid IPv4 and would prevent NGAP registration to AMF.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Key lines:
  - `[LIBCONFIG] ... cu_case_16.conf - line 91: syntax error`
  - `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`
  - `init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed`
  - `function config_libconfig_init returned -1`
- Interpretation:
  - The CU configuration file contains a parse error around line 91. Given the known misconfigured parameter, the most probable cause is an invalid key/value on the AMF IP line (wrong key name or malformed value).
  - Because config does not load, CU never binds F1-C, NGAP, or GTP-U. No further CU runtime logs (e.g., NGAP SCTP connect to AMF) appear.
- Cross-reference with `network_config.cu_conf`:
  - The provided structured JSON uses `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF`. If the actual `.conf` still uses `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4`, that mismatch in schema, paired with an invalid IPv4 literal, explains the parsing failure.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- Initialization appears normal (SA mode, Band n78, TDD config, threads).
- F1-C attempts:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by `F1AP ... retrying...`
- DU state:
  - `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` persists. Thus rfsimulator server is not made available to UE.
- Mapping to config:
  - DU addresses match `du_conf.MACRLCs` and CU’s `local_s_address`/ports. The refusal is due to CU not running (config error), not a wrong DU address/port.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes normally for SA n78 and immediately tries to connect to rfsimulator server:
  - `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` repeating with `errno(111)`.
- This is consistent with DU keeping the rfsim server closed until F1 setup completes.
- No PRACH/SIB or RRC messages appear, because there is no gNB RF side active in rfsimulator.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU dies during config load (syntax error near line 91).
  - DU cannot connect F1-C to CU: connection refused; DU waits for F1 Setup Response; radio not activated; rfsimulator server not listening.
  - UE fails to connect to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043 because it isn’t up.
- Misconfigured parameter linkage:
  - The declared misconfigured parameter is `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=999.999.999.999`, which is both an invalid IPv4 address and likely an invalid key for the current OAI CU config schema. Either can trigger a parse error: invalid tokenization of IP or unknown key in this position, hence `[LIBCONFIG] ... syntax error`.
  - Even if the CU had parsed the file, an invalid AMF IP would prevent NGAP SCTP connection to AMF (per OAI’s NGAP client), causing registration failure. In this dataset, we never reach that state because the CU aborts earlier.
- Therefore, the practical, immediate root cause of the observed system behavior is: CU configuration syntax error on the AMF IP line (invalid key and value), preventing CU startup. The misconfiguration originates from setting an invalid AMF IPv4 address and using an outdated key name not matching the current config schema.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Primary fix steps:
  1) Correct the CU configuration to use the current `NETWORK_INTERFACES` block and set a valid, reachable AMF IPv4 address. For a local docker-based AMF, this is often `127.0.0.1` or the host/container IP; for a LAN AMF, use its real LAN IP (e.g., `192.168.8.43`). Ensure routing/iptables allow SCTP to AMF’s NGAP port (default 38412).
  2) Remove any deprecated keys like `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4` and ensure no malformed literals. Keep only one authoritative field.
  3) After the CU starts, verify NGAP connects to AMF; the DU should then complete F1 setup and activate radio; the UE should subsequently connect to rfsimulator server.

- Suggested corrected snippets (JSON-style with comments), aligned to the provided `network_config` structure:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
        "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3",
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          // Changed to a valid and reachable AMF IP. Example keeps the provided value
          // if that host actually runs AMF; otherwise set to your AMF IP, e.g. "127.0.0.1".
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        }
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      // No change needed for F1 addressing; DU already points to CU at 127.0.0.5
      // Ensure DU can reach CU and keep rfsimulator server default
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server",
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change required for this issue; UE network/radio settings are fine.
      "uicc0": {
        "imsi": "001010000000001",
        "dnn": "oai",
        "nssai_sst": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Operational validation steps after the fix:
  - Start CU and check for NGAP SCTP association to AMF (logs should show successful connection/NG Setup).
  - Start DU; F1AP should connect, and DU should log radio activation.
  - Start UE; it should connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, perform cell search, decode SIB1, and attempt PRACH.
  - If NGAP fails after syntax fix, re-verify `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` reachability (ping/route, SCTP open), AMF service health, and firewall rules.

---

## 7. Limitations

- CU logs are truncated to the config-load failure; we do not observe subsequent NGAP behavior. The analysis infers the impact of an invalid AMF IP based on OAI’s expected runtime.
- The provided `network_config` is a structured view that may differ from the raw `.conf` used by CU (e.g., deprecated key name at line 91). The exact line content is not shown, but the misconfigured parameter and syntax error strongly implicate that line.
- No external spec lookup was required; behavior aligns with OAI CU/DU/UE control flow and rfsimulator lifecycle where DU activates the server post F1 setup, and UE depends on that to connect.
