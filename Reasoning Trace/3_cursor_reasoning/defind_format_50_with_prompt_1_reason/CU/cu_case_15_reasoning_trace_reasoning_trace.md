## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs show OAI NR-SA with rfsimulator: CU and DU launched with "--rfsim --sa", and UE tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`. Expected flow: CU starts (NGAP, F1-C endpoint), DU starts (PHY/MAC init), DU↔CU F1 setup, DU activates radio and rfsim server, UE connects to rfsim server, PRACH/RA, RRC setup, PDU session.

Network configuration summary from `network_config`:
- gNB-CU:
  - F1-C: `local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, DU remote `127.0.0.3`; ports c/d 501/2152↔500/2152. NG interfaces set (`GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43`).
  - Security: `ciphering_algorithms=[nea3, nea2, nea1, nea0]`, `integrity_algorithms=[nia2, nia0]`.
  - Misconfigured: `security.drb_ciphering=invalid_yes_no` (only yes/no allowed). `drb_integrity=no`.
- gNB-DU:
  - F1-C: local_n_address `127.0.0.3`, remote CU `127.0.0.5`. Serving cell: FR1 n78, μ=1, `N_RB=106`, PRACH index 98, TDD pattern consistent with logs.
  - rfsimulator: `serverport=4043`, server mode (DU side provides server; UE is client).
- UE:
  - IMSI `001010000000001`. FR1 n78 settings inferred from logs (3619.2 MHz, μ=1, N_RB=106). UE tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial mismatch guided by misconfigured_param: CU rejects config due to invalid `drb_ciphering`, which prevents CU startup, F1 setup, and DU radio activation. This cascades to UE rfsim connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA mode, parses config, and immediately reports: "in configuration file, bad drb_ciphering value 'invalid_yes_no', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed". This is an RRC-level configuration validation error during CU init.
- After this, we only see repeated "Reading '...Params'" lines; there is no NGAP/AMF connection establishment, no F1AP listener confirmation. This indicates CU initialization is not completing to operational state.
- Cross-check with `cu_conf.security`: `drb_ciphering=invalid_yes_no` matches the exact error. CU therefore fails early and does not accept F1-C connections.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 successfully, prints serving cell parameters consistent with `du_conf` (FR1 n78, `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280` → 3619.2 MHz, μ=1, N_RB 106, TDD 5 ms period). No PHY errors.
- DU attempts F1-C association to CU: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" then repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` with retries.
- DU prints "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" and does not activate the radio or rfsim server path. This is expected: without CU, DU cannot proceed to active state.
- Conclusion: DU is healthy but blocked by CU not listening on F1-C due to CU security config error.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes in FR1 n78, μ=1, N_RB 106, TDD. It acts as rfsimulator client: "Running as client" and repeatedly tries `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111) connection refused`.
- In this topology, the DU runs the rfsim server at port 4043. Because DU is waiting for F1 Setup Response (blocked by CU failure), DU does not bring up the rfsim server endpoint, so UE connections are refused.
- No PRACH or RRC attempts occur; UE is stuck at transport connectivity stage.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU rejects config at security validation → CU not operational, no F1-C listener.
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect to CU (`Connection refused`) → DU does not activate radio or rfsim server.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` → repeated `errno(111)`.
- Misconfigured parameter driven root cause: `security.drb_ciphering=invalid_yes_no` is invalid. OAI expects `yes` or `no`. The CU log explicitly flags this exact value as invalid. Because DRB ciphering policy is parsed at CU startup (RRC/PDCP configuration), the CU aborts or stalls initialization, leading to the cascading failures observed.
- Specification background: While DRB ciphering policy is implementation/config policy (not directly mandated by 3GPP value strings), the behavior aligns with OAI’s configuration schema that enforces boolean choices for DRB ciphering. The functional impact is system-wide because CU owns RRC/PDCP policies and F1-C control; without CU readiness, DU and UE cannot proceed.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Immediate fix: set `security.drb_ciphering` to a valid boolean string. Choose `"yes"` (recommended default) unless you intentionally want to disable DRB ciphering for testing.
- Keep `drb_integrity` aligned with your test needs; `"no"` is acceptable for lab setups, but for realism use `"yes"` with a supported integrity algorithm.
- After change, restart CU first, confirm CU logs show NGAP and F1AP readiness, then start DU, verify F1 Setup completes and DU activates radio and rfsim server, then start UE and observe PRACH/RA and RRC.

Corrected `network_config` snippets (JSON; comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "security": {
      "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
      "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],
      "drb_ciphering": "yes",  // changed from invalid_yes_no → yes
      "drb_integrity": "no"     // keep as-is for this scenario
    }
  }
}
```

No changes required in `du_conf` or `ue_conf` for this incident. Optional sanity checks:
- Verify CU/DU F1-C addressing remains `127.0.0.5` (CU) and `127.0.0.3` (DU) with ports 501/500.
- Ensure `rfsimulator.serverport=4043` (DU) matches UE client port (it does) and that DU transitions to active state before UE attempts to connect.
- If security policies are tightened later, ensure selected `neaX`/`niaX` are supported on both sides.

Further debugging steps if issues persist after fix:
- Increase CU `rrc_log_level`/`pdcp_log_level` to `debug` to confirm DRB policy application.
- Check CU prints for "F1AP listener ready" and DU side for "F1 Setup Response received".
- Confirm DU log shows rfsim time manager and radio activation after F1 setup.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not include explicit CU termination lines or timestamps, but the explicit CU error on `drb_ciphering` is decisive.
- We did not need external spec lookup because the error is produced by OAI’s config validator; the cascade inferred is standard for CU/DU/rfsim topologies.
