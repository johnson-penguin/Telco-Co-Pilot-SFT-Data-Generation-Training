## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We are analyzing an OAI 5G NR SA deployment using rfsim: CU, DU, and UE binaries are launched with SA mode. Expected flow: component init → CU-AMF NGAP setup → CU–DU F1 setup → DU brings up cell (SSB/SS raster) → UE connects via PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session. The focus is on configuration consistency for numerology, SSB raster, and PRACH among `gnb.conf` and `ue.conf`.

From network_config (DU `servingCellConfigCommon`), several numerology fields are set to `4`: `dl_subcarrierSpacing=4`, `ul_subcarrierSpacing=4`, `initialDLBWPsubcarrierSpacing=4`, `initialULBWPsubcarrierSpacing=4`, and a separate top-level `subcarrierSpacing=4`. In OAI JSON, numerology uses index mapping: 0→15 kHz, 1→30 kHz, 2→60 kHz, 3→120 kHz, 4→240 kHz. Band n78 is FR1; SSB subcarrier spacing allowed per spec is 15 or 30 kHz for FR1. Setting 240 kHz (index 4) for FR1 SSB/serving cell causes the SSB raster validation to fail.

CU logs show normal NGAP setup with AMF and F1AP startup. DU logs show an assertion in `check_ssb_raster()` complaining it “Couldn't find band 78 with SCS 4”. UE logs show `SSB numerology 1` (30 kHz) and repeated failures to connect to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 because the DU server never comes up due to the raster assertion. Thus we enter analysis guided by `misconfigured_param = "subcarrierSpacing=4"`.

Key params parsed:
- DU: `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280` (3619.2 MHz, n78), `dl/ul_subcarrierSpacing=4 (240 kHz)`, `initialDL/ULBWPsubcarrierSpacing=4`, `referenceSubcarrierSpacing=1 (30 kHz)`, `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98`, `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=1 (30 kHz)`, TDD pattern given. `rfsimulator.serveraddr="server"`, `serverport=4043`.
- CU: NG/NGU IP 192.168.8.43, F1 local 127.0.0.5, remote 127.0.0.3.
- UE: IMSI/keys present; RF init shows DL freq 3619200000 Hz, SSB numerology 1 (30 kHz), N_RB_DL 106, attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 as rfsim client.

Immediate mismatch: DU uses SCS index 4 (240 kHz) for FR1 band 78, while UE expects SSB numerology 1 (30 kHz). This aligns with the DU assertion and crash.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; RAN context initialized; threads spawned (SCTP, NGAP, RRC, GTPU, CU_F1).
- NGAP: NGSetupRequest sent, NGSetupResponse received; AMF association established; GTP-U configured on 192.168.8.43:2152. F1AP started at CU.
- No critical anomalies; CU waits for DU F1 association. CU side appears healthy.

Cross-ref: CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` show NG and NGU at 192.168.8.43 matching logs. F1 SCTP request for 127.0.0.5 indicates loopback F1 with DU at 127.0.0.3 as per DU `MACRLCs`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- SA mode; PHY/MAC/L1 initialized; serving cell config read. Conversion shows `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz` (n78 FR1).
- Fatal path:
  - `Assertion (start_gscn != 0) failed! In check_ssb_raster() ... Couldn't find band 78 with SCS 4`
  - Process exits via `_Assert_Exit_`.

Interpretation: OAI validates the SSB raster against band and SSB SCS. For FR1 n78, 240 kHz SSB (index 4) is invalid; valid are 15/30 kHz. With invalid SSB SCS, `check_ssb_raster` cannot find a valid GSCN start, triggers assert, and the DU terminates. Because DU dies, it never starts the rfsimulator server, so no PHY comes up, and no F1 association occurs.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with `SSB numerology 1` (30 kHz) at 3619.2 MHz, consistent with FR1 n78 and typical OAI configs (106 PRBs at 30 kHz).
- UE repeatedly tries connecting to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused). This is a consequence of the DU crash; there is no rfsim server listening.
- Secondary observation: DU `rfsimulator.serveraddr` is set to "server" (a name OAI resolves to localhost by default in many setups), while UE explicitly targets 127.0.0.1. Even if the DU were up, ensuring both sides point consistently to the same address is recommended, but here the primary blocker is the DU fatal assert.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU completes NGAP; DU initializes then crashes on SSB raster validation due to `subcarrierSpacing=4` (240 kHz). Without DU, rfsim server is down, so UE connection attempts fail; CU awaits DU over F1.
- Root cause (guided by `misconfigured_param`): `subcarrierSpacing=4` in DU `servingCellConfigCommon` forces 240 kHz numerology inappropriate for FR1 band 78 SSB/raster. OAI's `check_ssb_raster()` rejects SCS 4 for band 78 and aborts. UE logs expecting SSB numerology 1 (30 kHz) further confirm mismatch.
- PRACH: `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=1` (30 kHz) and `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98` appear plausible for n78 at 30 kHz; PRACH never starts because DU fails earlier at SSB raster.

External knowledge reference: 3GPP NR defines permitted SSB subcarrier spacings: FR1 supports 15/30 kHz; FR2 supports 120/240 kHz. Using 240 kHz SSB in FR1 bands is invalid, matching OAI’s raster check behavior for n78.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix: Use FR1-appropriate numerology (30 kHz) across serving cell and initial BWPs:
- Set `subcarrierSpacing` fields to index 1 (30 kHz) for SSB/reference and for DL/UL BWPs.
- Keep `referenceSubcarrierSpacing=1` as-is.
- Keep `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=1` (30 kHz) consistent with 30 kHz SSB.

Also align rfsim addressing to avoid ambiguity:
- Set DU `rfsimulator.serveraddr` to `127.0.0.1` (or ensure name resolves identically) to match the UE client target.

Proposed corrected snippets within the network_config structure (comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "servingCellConfigCommon": [
          {
            "dl_subcarrierSpacing": 1,            // was 4 (240 kHz) → 1 (30 kHz) for FR1 n78
            "ul_subcarrierSpacing": 1,            // was 4 → 1
            "initialDLBWPsubcarrierSpacing": 1,   // was 4 → 1
            "initialULBWPsubcarrierSpacing": 1,   // was 4 → 1
            "subcarrierSpacing": 1,               // was 4 → 1 (serving cell numerology / SSB reference)
            "referenceSubcarrierSpacing": 1,      // keep 1 (30 kHz)
            "prach_ConfigurationIndex": 98,       // unchanged; valid for 30 kHz in typical OAI n78 configs
            "msg1_SubcarrierSpacing": 1           // keep 1 (30 kHz)
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",                 // align with UE client target
      "serverport": 4043
    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "uicc0": {
      "imsi": "001010000000001"
      // no UE-side numerology changes needed; UE already logs SSB numerology 1 (30 kHz)
    }
  }
}
```

After applying:
- DU should pass `check_ssb_raster()` for n78, bring up SSB/SS raster and PHY, and start rfsim server.
- UE should connect to rfsim successfully and proceed to PRACH.
- CU–DU F1 association should complete; UE attach and PDU session should follow.

Further validation steps:
- Re-run DU; confirm no raster assert and SSB is transmitted.
- Verify UE sync to SSB and successful PRACH; check MAC/RRC logs for RA-RNTI and RRC Setup Complete.
- Confirm F1 connection established (F1AP UEContextSetup etc.) and NGAP path remains stable.
- If PRACH issues arise, cross-check `prach_ConfigurationIndex` against TS 38.211 tables for 30 kHz and chosen SSB periodicity; but given prior OAI defaults, 98 is commonly used with n78/30 kHz.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and untimestamped; we infer ordering from message semantics.
- The JSON shows only selected fields; there may be other numerology fields in other sections that should also be consistent (e.g., additional BWPs, SIB configs).
- PRACH index validity is assumed typical for OAI n78 at 30 kHz; if local modifications exist, re-validate against 3GPP TS 38.211/38.331 tables and OAI implementation notes.
