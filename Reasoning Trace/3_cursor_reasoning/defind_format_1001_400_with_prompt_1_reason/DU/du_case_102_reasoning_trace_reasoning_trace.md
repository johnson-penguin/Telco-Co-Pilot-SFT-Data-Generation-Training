## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. CU is in SA mode, brings up NGAP with AMF and starts F1AP. DU should initialize PHY/MAC/RRC, bring up F1-C/SCTP toward CU and bind GTP-U locally, and start the rfsimulator server. UE attempts to connect to that rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.

Guided by misconfigured_param: MACRLCs[0].local_n_address = abc.def.ghi.jkl. This is not a valid IPv4 literal or resolvable hostname. OAI uses this address for F1-C SCTP binding/connection and for GTP-U local bind. An invalid address causes getaddrinfo() to fail, which triggers assertions in SCTP and prevents GTP-U instantiation; DU aborts before radio operation and rfsim server startup.

Network_config highlights relevant to F1/GTP binding:
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].tr_n_preference = "f1"
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].local_n_address = abc.def.ghi.jkl (invalid)
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address = 127.0.0.5 (CU side; valid)
- All RF/TDD/SCS parameters are coherent for n78 and are not implicated by this failure.

Expected flow: CU up (NGAP/F1AP ready) → DU binds local F1-C/SCTP and GTP-U on a valid IP, connects to CU → DU starts rfsim server → UE connects, decodes SIB, performs RA → RRC attach and PDU session. Here, DU fails at network address resolution/binding and exits early, so UE cannot connect.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGSetupRequest/Response successful; CU starts F1AP and creates sockets on 127.0.0.5.
- CU shows no fatal errors and waits for DU association.
- No subsequent F1AP DU association events—consistent with DU failing to establish F1-C/SCTP.

Cross-reference: CU interfaces and IDs match `NETWORK_INTERFACES`. CU is not impacted by the DU’s invalid local bind address except that F1 never completes.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU proceeds through PHY/MAC/RRC init with coherent radio parameters and prints TDD and frame settings.
- Critical failures:
  - F1AP DU line indicates: `F1-C DU IPaddr abc.def.ghi.jkl, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to abc.def.ghi.jkl`.
  - GTP-U: `Initializing UDP for local address abc.def.ghi.jkl ... getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known` → cannot create GTP-U instance.
  - SCTP: `Assertion (status == 0) failed!` in `sctp_handle_new_association_req()` with `getaddrinfo(abc.def.ghi.jkl) failed`.
  - Later: `Assertion (gtpInst > 0) failed!` in `F1AP_DU_task(): cannot create DU F1-U GTP module`.
- Interpretation: The invalid `local_n_address` breaks both SCTP and GTP-U name resolution/bind, triggering assertions and causing DU exit. This occurs after configuration is read but before networking is operational; the rfsim server later connection attempts from UE will fail because DU exits.

Link to network_config: `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address` is explicitly set to an invalid hostname in the provided DU config block, matching the failures.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE typically initializes RF and then attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043. With DU aborting on invalid address binding, rfsim server won’t be active, so UE would see errno 111 (connection refused) repeatedly.
- Regardless of correct RF settings, UE cannot progress without a running DU.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU reads config → attempts to bind/connect using `abc.def.ghi.jkl` → getaddrinfo() fails → SCTP and GTP-U assertions → DU exits → UE cannot connect to rfsim → CU sees no DU association.
- Root cause: Invalid DU `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address`. OAI requires a valid local IP/hostname for F1-C/SCTP and GTP-U binding. Invalid/unknown names cause immediate failures at socket setup.
- Context: This is a transport/network configuration issue, not PHY/MAC. Using loopback or a valid local IP resolves the issue.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix DU `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address` to a valid IP reachable on the host (loopback in rfsim setups):
  - Set `local_n_address` to `127.0.0.3` (commonly used DU loopback in OAI examples).
  - Keep `remote_n_address` as `127.0.0.5` (CU side), ensuring addresses are consistent across CU/DU configs.
- Validate after change:
  - DU should resolve/bind SCTP and GTP-U successfully; F1AP DU should connect to CU; rfsim server should be active on 4043.
  - UE should connect, decode SIB, and proceed to RA/RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - Ensure no other fields reference `abc.def.ghi.jkl` (e.g., any NETWORK_INTERFACES or rfsimulator sections).
  - Confirm firewall rules allow local bindings if not using pure loopback.

    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No changes needed for this issue
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update the DU config to set `local_n_address = 127.0.0.3` and verify CU’s `remote_s_address` points to that same IP.
- Restart DU; confirm SCTP/GTP-U stack initializes without `getaddrinfo` errors and F1AP connects.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, SIB decode, RA, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- The logs show the invalid address directly; however, environment-specific routing may require different local IPs if not using loopback. Adjust accordingly.
- Timestamps are absent; sequencing is inferred from log order and OAI behavior.
- This analysis assumes a single-host rfsim topology; for multi-host, ensure proper IP reachability and routing between CU and DU nodes.
