## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. CU is in SA mode, brings up NGAP with AMF and starts F1AP. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC, brings up F1-C/SCTP toward CU and binds GTP-U locally, and starts the rfsimulator server. UE attempts to connect to that rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.

Guided by misconfigured_param: MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address = abc.def.ghi.jkl. This is not a valid IPv4 literal or resolvable hostname. OAI uses this address as the remote endpoint for F1-C SCTP (CU) and also as the peer for F1-U GTP-U. An invalid remote address causes getaddrinfo() to fail on the DU while initiating the F1-C association; DU then aborts before end-to-end connectivity and before UE can proceed.

Network_config highlights relevant to F1/GTP endpoints:
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].tr_n_preference = "f1"
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].local_n_address = 127.0.0.3 (valid local bind)
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address = abc.def.ghi.jkl (invalid CU address)
- cu_conf.gNBs.local/remote addresses indicate CU is on 127.0.0.5 and expects DU at 127.0.0.3.
- RF/TDD/SCS parameters are coherent for n78 and not implicated by this failure.

Expected flow: CU up (NGAP/F1AP) → DU binds local F1-C/SCTP and connects to CU at a valid address → DU starts rfsim server → UE connects, decodes SIB, performs RA → RRC attach and PDU session. Here, DU fails at resolving the CU’s remote address and exits; UE cannot connect to rfsim.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGSetupRequest/Response successful; CU starts F1AP and creates sockets on 127.0.0.5.
- CU shows no fatal errors and waits for DU association.
- Absence of DU association events is consistent with DU failing to resolve/connect to the CU address.

Cross-reference: CU network interface config matches 127.0.0.5 for CU, 127.0.0.3 for DU.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU completes radio init and prints coherent MAC/TDD settings.
- Critical lines:
  - `F1AP ... F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU abc.def.ghi.jkl, binding GTP to 127.0.0.3` (shows invalid remote CU address).
  - GTP-U local init succeeds on 127.0.0.3.
  - SCTP: `Assertion (status == 0) failed!` in `sctp_handle_new_association_req()` with `getaddrinfo() failed: Name or service not known`.
  - DU exits after SCTP failure; later components depending on F1-C cannot proceed.
- Interpretation: The invalid `remote_n_address` breaks remote endpoint resolution for F1-C, causing assertion and exit. Local GTP-U init may succeed but end-to-end F1-U setup will still fail because F1-C never establishes.

Link to network_config: `MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address` is set to an invalid value in DU config; CU expects `127.0.0.5`.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE would repeatedly attempt to connect to rfsim (127.0.0.1:4043). If DU aborts before server start, UE gets errno 111 (connection refused). Even if DU had started rfsim, without F1-C established the system cannot proceed to full attach.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU reads config → attempts SCTP connect to `abc.def.ghi.jkl` → getaddrinfo() fails → SCTP assertion → DU exit → UE cannot connect to rfsim → CU sees no DU association.
- Root cause: Invalid DU `MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address`. DU must target a valid CU F1-C IP (127.0.0.5 in this topology). Name resolution failure aborts F1-C establishment.
- Context: Transport/network configuration issue, not PHY/MAC. Correcting the CU remote address resolves the startup failure.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix DU remote address:
  - Set `MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address` to `127.0.0.5` (CU address) and keep `local_n_address` as `127.0.0.3`.
  - Ensure CU `gNBs.remote_s_address` remains `127.0.0.3` (points back to DU).
- Validate after change:
  - DU should resolve/connect over SCTP to CU; F1AP association should be established; rfsim server should run.
  - UE should connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, decode SIB, perform RA, and proceed to RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - Confirm no other sections contain the invalid hostname.
  - If multi-host, replace loopbacks with reachable IPs and verify routing/firewall rules.

    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No change required for this issue
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update DU config to set `remote_n_address = 127.0.0.5`.
- Restart DU; confirm SCTP association with CU is established and F1AP is up.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, SIB decode, RA, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs do not show UE side for this case, but expected behavior is UE connect failures if DU exits early.
- Assumes single-host rfsim topology with loopback addresses; adapt for multi-host deployments.
- Timestamps are absent; sequencing inferred from typical OAI startup and log order.
