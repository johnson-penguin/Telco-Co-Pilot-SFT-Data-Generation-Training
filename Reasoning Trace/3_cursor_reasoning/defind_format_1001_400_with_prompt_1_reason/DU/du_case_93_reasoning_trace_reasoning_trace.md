## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR Standalone with RF simulator. CU logs confirm SA mode and successful NGAP setup with the AMF; CU starts F1AP and listens on loopback toward the DU (`127.0.0.5`). The UE is an RFSIM client repeatedly failing to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (connection refused), which typically means the DU-side RFSIM server never started. DU logs show immediate configuration parsing failure from libconfig with a syntax error at line 3 and abort of initialization, so no PHY/MAC nor RFSIM server comes up.

The provided `network_config` shows:
- CU (`cu_conf`): `Asn1_verbosity` is set to "none" (lowercase string), NGU/NGAP IPs `192.168.8.43`, F1 local `127.0.0.5` remote `127.0.0.3` consistent with CU/DU split. Other parameters are ordinary.
- DU (`du_conf`): RFSIM server mode is configured via `rfsimulator.serveraddr: "server"` and `serverport: 4043` (default). Serving cell config includes NR band n78, SCS 30 kHz (`subcarrierSpacing: 1`), PRACH settings (`prach_ConfigurationIndex: 98`, ZCZC 13), TDD UL/DL pattern fields populated and plausible. No `Asn1_verbosity` field is listed here in the JSON.
- UE (`ue_conf`): SIM credentials only; RF and RFSIM connection behavior come from runtime options; logs show TDD, n78 center frequency 3.6192 GHz, and the default RFSIM client to 127.0.0.1:4043.

The declared misconfiguration is `Asn1_verbosity=None`. In OAI configs this key expects a string value among a small set (e.g., "none", "info", sometimes "annoying"). Using bare `None` (capitalized, unquoted) is invalid libconfig syntax and causes early parse failure. The DU log’s syntax error at line 3 is consistent with such a top-level malformed key near the start of the file (typical location for `Asn1_verbosity`). Therefore, we assume the DU error-case `.conf` has `Asn1_verbosity=None` (unquoted/invalid), leading to DU abort and subsequent UE connection refusals.

Initial mismatch summary:
- Misconfigured parameter: `Asn1_verbosity=None` vs CU JSON having `"Asn1_verbosity": "none"`. The DU error-case config likely contains the invalid token, causing libconfig failure.
- As a result, DU doesn’t start; CU is up; UE cannot connect to RFSIM server.

Expected flow (if healthy): CU/DU initialize → F1AP association → DU starts RFSIM server on 4043 → UE connects → PRACH attempt → RRC connection → PDU Session. Here the flow breaks at DU init due to config parse error.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA, configures NGAP and GTP-U, and successfully performs NGSetup with AMF. It then starts F1AP and opens SCTP toward `127.0.0.5` (CU side) with remote `127.0.0.3` (DU). No crash or anomalies are indicated; CU is waiting for DU F1 association.
- Cross-check with `cu_conf.gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES`: NGU/NG-AMF IPs `192.168.8.43` match log lines showing GTPU config to the same address and port 2152. F1 addresses in `gNBs` (`local_s_address: 127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address: 127.0.0.3`) match F1AP startup lines.
- Nothing in CU indicates awareness of the DU parse failure yet; it would simply wait on F1 connection.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- The DU immediately reports: `libconfig ... syntax error` and `config_libconfig_init returned -1`, then aborts init. This prevents creation of MAC/RLC, L1, RUs, and most notably the RFSIMULATOR server endpoint.
- Given the declared misconfiguration `Asn1_verbosity=None`, OAI’s libconfig expects a string literal for `Asn1_verbosity`. A bare `None` (without quotes) is not a valid token in libconfig and commonly triggers an early parse error near the beginning of the file (often around line 3–6), exactly matching the DU log.
- With DU down, there are no PHY/MAC logs (no PRACH, no TDD pattern confirmation), reinforcing that the failure happens before radio stack initialization.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE hardware and PHY init complete for n78, 30 kHz SCS, 106 PRBs at 3.6192 GHz. It then acts as RFSIM client and repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, receiving `errno(111)` (connection refused) in a loop.
- This behavior is typical when the DU-side RFSIM server is not running. Because the DU failed to parse its configuration, it never bound to port 4043, so the UE cannot proceed to random access (PRACH) or higher-layer procedures.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - DU parse failure at startup → no F1 to CU, no RFSIM server.
  - CU stays up and waits for DU on F1.
  - UE cannot connect to RFSIM server and loops with connection refused.
- Root cause guided by `misconfigured_param`:
  - The DU error-case `.conf` likely contains `Asn1_verbosity=None`. This is syntactically invalid for libconfig (expecting a quoted string). The failure occurs before any radio configuration takes effect, explaining the absence of DU PHY/MAC logs and the UE connection refusal.
- There is no evidence of PRACH/index/scheduling or SIB encoding issues; the fault precedes those layers.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Ensure `Asn1_verbosity` uses a valid string value. Recommended: set to "none" (lowercase, quoted), or remove the key to rely on defaults.

Configuration snippets (illustrative corrected values) within your `network_config` structure:

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "Asn1_verbosity": "none"
  },
  "du_conf": {
    "Asn1_verbosity": "none",
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "server",
      "serverport": 4043
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- On the DU, adding `"Asn1_verbosity": "none"` (if your DU template uses it) or correcting any existing invalid entry fixes libconfig parsing.
- After correction, the DU should start, open the RFSIM server on port 4043, and proceed with F1 association to the CU. The UE should then connect, allowing PRACH and RRC procedures to begin.

Validation and next steps:
- Re-run DU with the fixed config; verify logs proceed past config load, RU/L1 init, and RFSIM server binding.
- Observe UE log for successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and subsequent PRACH attempts.
- Confirm CU shows incoming F1 connection from DU.
- Optional: increase `log_config` levels if further diagnosis is needed after the fix.

## 7. Limitations
- The DU error-case file content isn’t shown; the hypothesis assumes `Asn1_verbosity=None` appears early and unquoted, consistent with the reported syntax error. The `network_config` JSON mirrors a normalized/clean view and does not include the faulty token in DU, so we infer from logs and the declared misconfiguration.
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; fine-grained timing correlation is approximated. No 3GPP PRACH/PHY specification checks are necessary because the failure occurs at configuration parsing.

Conclusion: The DU fails at configuration parsing due to invalid `Asn1_verbosity=None`. Correcting it to a valid quoted string (e.g., "none") allows DU startup, RFSIM server availability, UE connection, and end-to-end procedures to proceed.
