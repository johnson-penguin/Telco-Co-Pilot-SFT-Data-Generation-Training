## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- Expected setup: OAI NR SA with `--rfsim --sa`. CU initializes NGAP and F1; DU should start PHY/MAC and expose rfsim server; UE connects to rfsim, performs PRACH/RA, then RRC attach and PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: "log_config.global_log_level=None". In OAI, `global_log_level` must be a valid string (e.g., "info", "debug"); `None` is invalid for libconfig and will trigger parse or semantic errors.
- Network config summary (key items used for correlation):
  - cu_conf: NG/NGU IPs `192.168.8.43`, AMF `192.168.70.132`, `log_config.global_log_level=info` (valid).
  - du_conf: SA/TDD band n78; PRACH `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98` with standard SCS=30 kHz; rfsimulator serverport 4043; `log_config` contains only per-stack levels (hw/phy/mac) but no `global_log_level` field shown in extracted JSON. If the actual DU `.conf` file contained `global_log_level=None`, this would be invalid.
  - ue_conf: IMSI and basic SIM values; UE PHY tuned to DL 3619.2 MHz (n78, 106 PRBs), consistent with DU.
- Initial mismatch flags from logs vs config:
  - DU log shows libconfig syntax error at line 240, then “config module not properly initialized” and init abort. This is consistent with an invalid token/value like `None` for a string field (e.g., `global_log_level=None`).
  - UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 → indicates DU never brought up rfsim server due to early config failure.

Conclusion: The system is blocked at DU startup due to a configuration parse failure likely rooted in the misconfigured `log_config.global_log_level=None` (per the provided misconfigured_param).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU boot sequence is normal: SA mode, threads spawn, NGAP connects to AMF, NGSetupRequest/Response successful, GTP-U configured, F1AP started, SCTP to DU address `127.0.0.5`/`127.0.0.3` ports align with `cu_conf`/`du_conf`.
- No anomalies: CU is ready and waiting for DU over F1; nothing indicates CU-side config problems.
- Cross-check with `cu_conf`: NG IPs (`192.168.8.43`) match the CU logs. `global_log_level=info` is valid and not implicated.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- Critical lines:
  - `file .../du_case_99.conf - line 240: syntax error`
  - `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`
  - `config_get, section log_config skipped, config module not properly initialized`
  - `LOG init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed`
- These indicate a parser-level failure (not just a semantic warning). In libconfig, assigning a non-string like `None` to a string key (e.g., `global_log_level`) is a syntax/semantic violation depending on exact notation; either way it prevents initialization of the `log_config` section and, subsequently, all dependent sections.
- Because DU aborts early, the rfsim server never comes up and MAC/PHY are not initialized. Hence, the DU cannot accept F1 connection and cannot serve UE RF.
- Cross-reference with `du_conf` extract: The JSON extract shows only per-module log levels and lacks `global_log_level`. The misconfigured_param explicitly tells us the error case contained `global_log_level=None`. That would produce exactly this libconfig error at or near that line.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY successfully for n78, 106 PRBs; threads start; then it tries to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Repeated `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` (connection refused): server socket is not listening → DU rfsim server not started due to DU config failure.
- UE parameters (frequency, numerology) are aligned with DU’s intended config, so the immediate UE-side issue is purely transport to rfsim server.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU reaches operational state and awaits DU over F1.
  - DU fails at config parse → never initializes L1/MAC, never starts rfsim server.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server (connection refused) → no PRACH, no RRC.
- Given `misconfigured_param = log_config.global_log_level=None`, and DU logs showing a syntax error and config module not initialized, the root cause is an invalid logging configuration value in the DU configuration file. In OAI, `global_log_level` expects known strings (e.g., `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, possibly `trace`). The literal `None` is not valid in libconfig syntax for a string field and leads to a parsing/initialization failure.
- Therefore, the fundamental blocker is the DU’s invalid `log_config.global_log_level` setting, which cascades to prevent rfsim server startup and all higher-layer procedures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Correct the DU configuration:
  - Replace `log_config.global_log_level=None` with a valid level, e.g., `info` (safe default) or `debug` for troubleshooting.
  - Ensure the value is quoted as a string in libconfig syntax: `global_log_level = "info";`
  - Verify the entire `log_config` block is syntactically correct (trailing commas/semicolons, braces).
- After the correction:
  - DU should initialize successfully, start rfsim server on port 4043.
  - UE connection attempts to 127.0.0.1:4043 should succeed; then PRACH RA, RRC, and PDU session establishment can proceed.
- Optional validation steps:
  - Start DU with `--check-config` or run DU with `--log-level=debug` initially to confirm parse.
  - Confirm rfsim port is listening: `ss -lntp | grep 4043` on the DU host.
  - Observe UE logs for successful connection and RA attempts, and CU logs for F1AP association.
- Corrected configuration snippets (embedded into the given network_config structure). Comments explain the changes.

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        // Fixed: add valid global level instead of None
        "global_log_level": "info",
        "hw_log_level": "info",
        "phy_log_level": "info",
        "mac_log_level": "info"
      }
    },
    "cu_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        // CU already valid; keep as-is or align verbosity if desired
        "global_log_level": "info",
        "hw_log_level": "info",
        "phy_log_level": "info",
        "mac_log_level": "info",
        "rlc_log_level": "info",
        "pdcp_log_level": "info",
        "rrc_log_level": "info",
        "ngap_log_level": "info",
        "f1ap_log_level": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- If the DU still fails after the fix, inspect the exact line flagged (line 240) for any additional syntax issues (missing semicolon, stray comma, mismatched quotes).
- Note: rfsimulator `serveraddr` shown as "server" is expected for DU (server mode) in OAI; UE uses 127.0.0.1 client mode, which is consistent.

## 7. Limitations

- DU log excerpt does not print the faulty line content; we infer from the provided misconfigured_param that `global_log_level=None` is present and causing the syntax error.
- Timestamps are not provided; correlation is based on causal sequencing typical in OAI boot.
- No 3GPP spec lookup required here because the failure occurs at configuration parsing, before PHY/MAC procedures; domain knowledge about libconfig and OAI logging schema suffices.
