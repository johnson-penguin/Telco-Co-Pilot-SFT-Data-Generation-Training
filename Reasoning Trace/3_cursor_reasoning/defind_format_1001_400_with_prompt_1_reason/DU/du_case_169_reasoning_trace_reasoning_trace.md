## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The setup is OAI NR SA with `--rfsim` based on UE logs trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and DU/CU operating separately (CU shows NGAP setup to AMF; DU initializes PHY/MAC; UE is an RF simulator client).
- Expected call flow: CU initializes and connects to AMF → F1 interface between CU and DU → DU brings up PHY/MAC and starts RF simulator server → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB/RACH → RRC → PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: **`RUs[0].nb_tx = -1`** (in DU `RUs` section). This parameter denotes the number of physical TX antennas for the RU; negative is invalid and will break antenna resource checks.
- Quick parse of network_config:
  - `cu_conf.gNBs`: F1 CU setup with NG interfaces bound to `192.168.8.43`; AMF IP parsed correctly. Nothing alarming here.
  - `du_conf.gNBs[0]` antenna ports: `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2`, `pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2`, `pusch_AntennaPorts=4`, `maxMIMO_layers=1`. This implies logical DL antenna ports for PDSCH are `XP×N1×N2 = 2×2×1 = 4` and UL PUSCH ports `=4`.
  - `du_conf.RUs[0].nb_tx = -1` (misconfigured). With logical ports 4, OAI asserts `num_tx >= XP*N1*N2`.
  - PRACH parameters look sane: `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98`, `zeroCorrelationZoneConfig=13` (no DU PHY PRACH error reported).
  - `ue_conf` has only UICC info; RFsim client address defaults to `127.0.0.1` (observed in logs).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU runs SA, initializes NGAP and GTPU, and successfully exchanges NGSetup with AMF:
  - "Send NGSetupRequest" → "Received NGSetupResponse" indicates AMF connectivity is good.
  - F1AP starts at CU and attempts SCTP towards `127.0.0.5` (CU local_s_address), which aligns with `cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address` and DU `MACRLCs.remote_n_address=127.0.0.5`.
- No CU-side fatal errors; CU is likely waiting for DU F1 connection establishment.
- Cross-check: `NETWORK_INTERFACES` match the log for NGU/S1U on `192.168.8.43`, consistent.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 and quickly asserts:
  - Assertion: `num_tx >= config.pdsch_AntennaPorts.XP * config.pdsch_AntennaPorts.N1 * config.pdsch_AntennaPorts.N2` fails in `RCconfig_nr_macrlc()`.
  - Context string: "Number of logical antenna ports ... cannot be larger than physical antennas (nb_tx)".
- Given `XP=2`, `N1=2`, `N2=1` → required `num_tx >= 4`. Actual `nb_tx = -1` → invalid and less than 4, thus assertion and exit. This prevents DU from bringing up the RF simulator server.
- No PRACH/PHY timing errors precede the assertion; failure is entirely due to antenna configuration inconsistency (and invalid negative `nb_tx`).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE configures RF chains and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`:
  - Repeated `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` means connection refused; server not listening.
- This is a consequence of the DU crash: the RFsim server (on DU side) never starts, so UE cannot connect.
- The UE-side frequencies (N78, 3619.2 MHz, SCS=30 kHz, NRB=106) are standard and not implicated in this failure sequence.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - DU asserts and exits during config stage due to `nb_tx = -1` and `PDSCH` logical ports = 4.
  - CU proceeds fine but F1 link cannot be established without a running DU.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim server because DU never starts the server, producing connection refused loops.
- Root cause: **Invalid and inconsistent antenna configuration** in DU: `RUs[0].nb_tx = -1` (invalid) while `pdsch_AntennaPorts` implies 4 logical ports, violating OAI check `num_tx >= XP*N1*N2`.
- Specification and OAI knowledge:
  - In OAI, `nb_tx` must be a positive integer representing physical TX antenna count.
  - Logical antenna ports configured for PDSCH must not exceed physical TX antennas. Failing this, OAI asserts during `RCconfig_nr_macrlc()`.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Two consistent remediation options:
  - Option A (single-antenna rfsim typical): reduce logical ports to 1 and set `nb_tx = 1`.
  - Option B (match current logical ports): keep `XP=2, N1=2, N2=1` (logical 4) and set `nb_tx >= 4` (e.g., 4). Ensure `pusch_AntennaPorts` also aligns with capability.
- Given the current config already expects 4 logical ports, choose Option B for minimal changes: set `RUs[0].nb_tx = 4`.
- After change, re-run DU; verify that RFsim server starts; UE should connect and proceed to SSB detection and PRACH.

If preferring Option A (single-antenna minimal config), use instead:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "RUs": [
        {
          "nb_tx": 1,
          "_comment_nb_tx": "Single TX antenna typical for rfsim"
        }
      ],
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP": 1,
          "pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1": 1,
          "pusch_AntennaPorts": 1,
          "_comment_ports": "Match logical ports to single physical TX antenna"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Further checks after fix:
- Confirm DU starts and advertises RFsim server; UE should connect without errno 111.
- Observe F1AP setup completing between CU and DU.
- Verify SSB/PRACH events in UE and DU logs; proceed to RRC.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs provided are truncated and lack timestamps; precise ordering relies on typical OAI startup sequence.
- Only a subset of `ue_conf` is shown; RFsim client address is inferred from logs, not from config JSON.
- Analysis hinges on the explicit assertion and the known OAI constraint relating `nb_tx` to logical antenna ports; no deeper PHY misconfigurations were observed in the snippets.
