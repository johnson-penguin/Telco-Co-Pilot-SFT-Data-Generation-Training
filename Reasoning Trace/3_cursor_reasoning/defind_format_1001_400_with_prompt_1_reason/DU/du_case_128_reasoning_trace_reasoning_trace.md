## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. CU is in SA mode, brings up NGAP with AMF and starts F1AP. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC for TDD band n78. UE attempts to connect to the rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.

Guided by misconfigured_param: dl_carrierBandwidth = 0. In OAI, NR bandwidth-related logic maps the configured subcarrier spacing (SCS enum) and carrier bandwidth (in PRBs) into an internal bandwidth index used by helpers like get_supported_bw_mhz(). A zero DL carrier bandwidth is invalid and causes the mapping to fail, producing bw_index = -1, which triggers an assertion and aborts DU startup before rfsim server is active.

Network_config highlights relevant to BW/SCS:
- du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon[0].dl_carrierBandwidth = 0 (invalid; should be a valid PRB count such as 106 for 30 kHz SCS around 3.6192 GHz)
- Other DU ServingCellConfigCommon fields indicate n78, SCS 30 kHz, PointA and ABSFREQSSB consistent with 3619200000 Hz; UL bandwidth shows 106 PRBs.
- cu_conf network interfaces are consistent; not related to this failure.
- UE logs indicate N_RB_DL = 106 and SSB numerology 1 (30 kHz), which is coherent with typical n78 configs.

Expected flow: CU up (NGAP/F1AP) → DU up (MAC/RRC configured, rfsim server active) → UE connects to rfsim, decodes SIB, performs RA → RRC attach and PDU session. Here, DU aborts during BW/SCS mapping due to invalid dl_carrierBandwidth, so rfsim server never accepts UE connections.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGSetupRequest/Response successful; CU starts F1AP and creates sockets on 127.0.0.5.
- CU-UP acceptance and GTP-U creation occur; no fatal errors.
- No subsequent F1AP DU association events—consistent with DU failing before F1 setup completes.

Cross-reference with cu_conf: Interface IPs and ports match `NETWORK_INTERFACES`. No issues linked to bandwidth settings on CU side.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU begins normal radio initialization for n78, then aborts with:
  - Assertion (bw_index >= 0 && bw_index <= (sizeof(bandwidth_index_to_mhz)/sizeof(*(bandwidth_index_to_mhz)))) failed!
  - In get_supported_bw_mhz() ../../../common/utils/nr/nr_common.c:417
  - Bandwidth index -1 is invalid
  - Exiting execution
- Interpretation: With dl_carrierBandwidth = 0, the helper deriving the supported bandwidth MHz cannot map SCS/BW to a valid entry, returning -1 and tripping the assertion. This occurs while parsing ServingCellConfigCommon and before network sockets/rfsim server are up.

Link to network_config: DU has `dl_carrierBandwidth: 0`, which directly causes this; UL side shows 106 PRBs, and UE logs show 106 PRBs DL, so DL=0 is the lone inconsistent/misconfigured value.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with RF consistent with n78: SSB numerology 1 and N_RB_DL 106.
- It would then try to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and receive errno 111 (connection refused) because the DU aborts pre-start; rfsim server is not listening.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU reads ServingCellConfigCommon with dl_carrierBandwidth=0 → BW mapping returns -1 → assertion in get_supported_bw_mhz() → process exits → UE cannot connect to rfsim → CU sees no DU association.
- Root cause: `dl_carrierBandwidth=0` is invalid. For the given SCS (30 kHz) and frequency plan, DL PRB count should be 106 to match UE and UL configuration.
- Standards/context: 3GPP defines numerologies and channel bandwidths; OAI expects consistent PRB counts; a zero PRB bandwidth is nonsensical and rejected by internal checks.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix DU DL bandwidth to a valid PRB count consistent with the rest of the config and UE:
  - Set `dl_carrierBandwidth` to 106.
  - Ensure UL/DL PRB counts and initial BWP PRB settings remain coherent with SCS 30 kHz and frequency.
- Validate after change:
  - DU should pass BW mapping, complete MAC/RRC config, and start the rfsim server on 4043.
  - UE should connect, decode SIB, and proceed to RA/RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - Confirm PointA and ABSFREQSSB are consistent with 106 PRBs and band 78.
  - Keep PRACH/TDD fields unchanged as they appear coherent.

Operational steps:
- Update the DU config to set `dl_carrierBandwidth = 106`.
- Restart DU; verify the assertion is gone and rfsim listens on 4043.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect succeeds, SIB decode, RA, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs do not print the parsed DL PRB value directly; the assertion location and provided config with dl_carrierBandwidth=0 pinpoint the cause.
- Timestamps are absent; sequencing inferred from log order and OAI startup behavior.
- The valid PRB count depends on SCS and band; 106 is consistent with SCS=30 kHz and typical n78 deployments as also reflected by the UE logs.
