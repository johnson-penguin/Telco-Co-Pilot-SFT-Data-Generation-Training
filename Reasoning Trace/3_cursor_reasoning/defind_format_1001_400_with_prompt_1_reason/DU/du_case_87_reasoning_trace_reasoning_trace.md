\n+## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We analyze an OAI 5G NR SA deployment with rfsim. Expected flow: CU init and NGAP with AMF → DU establishes F1 with CU and configures PHY/RU → DU broadcasts SSB → UE synchronizes (SSB), performs PRACH, RRC attach, PDU session. The misconfigured parameter is a DU peer address for F1 networking: `MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address=999.999.999.999`.

In OAI, `MACRLCs.remote_n_address` specifies the CU peer for F1-C (SCTP) and F1-U (GTP-U) endpoints. An invalid IPv4 literal is not resolvable, so DU-side SCTP connect (or association request) and any GTP-U peer resolution fail, asserting early in transport setup. Consequently, F1 cannot be established or maintained; PHY bring-up may start but the process exits on transport errors. The UE, connecting as rfsim client, will then fail because the DU either never reaches a stable state or tears down shortly after initialization.

Key parsed params:
- DU `MACRLCs[0]`: `local_n_address=127.0.0.3` (valid), `remote_n_address=999.999.999.999` (invalid), ports consistent with OAI defaults.
- DU PHY config: FR1 n78, mu=1 (30 kHz), 106 PRBs, typical TDD pattern; antenna ports configured for 4×4.
- CU F1 binds at `127.0.0.5` (peer for DU), GTP-U also on loopback.
- UE: standard SA init; rfsim client attempts to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Initial mismatch: DU’s F1 peer (remote CU) IP is invalid; CU expects 127.0.0.5.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU runs SA, completes NGAP (NGSetupRequest/Response), starts F1AP. No DU setup completion shown; CU awaits DU association. CU networking consistent with loopback model (127.0.0.5).

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes GNB_APP/L1; serving cell and TDD printouts are normal. Transport phase shows:
  - Attempt to use `remote_n_address=999.999.999.999` as CU peer.
  - `getaddrinfo() failed: Name or service not known` in SCTP handler; assertion and exit follow.

Interpretation: Since the CU peer IP is invalid, SCTP association cannot be created. OAI asserts in `sctp_eNB_task`, causing DU termination before steady-state operation.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE repeatedly tries connecting to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 with `errno(111)` (connection refused). This is consistent with the DU not remaining up to host the rfsim server due to transport asserts.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU is healthy on NGAP and waiting; DU fails transport to CU because its remote address is invalid; UE cannot proceed without a stable DU/rfsim server. The misconfigured `remote_n_address` directly causes the SCTP `getaddrinfo` error and abort.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Set DU’s `remote_n_address` to the CU loopback IP (`127.0.0.5`) to match CU’s `local_s_address`. Keep DU `local_n_address=127.0.0.3`. Verify ports remain consistent.

  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "uicc0": {
      "imsi": "001010000000001"
      // UE unchanged; requires DU to be stable and rfsim server listening
    }
  }
}
```

Post-fix validation:
- DU should establish F1-C successfully (watch DU MAC and CU F1AP logs for Setup Request/Response and no SCTP errors). GTP-U should bind without peer resolution issues.
- DU should keep rfsim server running; UE connects and proceeds to SSB sync, PRACH, and RRC.
- If still failing, ensure the chosen IPs exist (loopback aliases) on the host; otherwise standardize on 127.0.0.1 for both ends and adjust CU accordingly.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; we infer standard OAI loopback topology. Transport-layer `getaddrinfo` errors conclusively indicate addressing misconfiguration as root cause.
