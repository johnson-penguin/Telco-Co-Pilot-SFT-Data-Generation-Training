## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR SA using rfsimulator. CU runs in SA mode with NGAP up to AMF and F1AP started. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC and crashes during SIB1 generation. UE repeatedly tries to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 but fails because the DU server is not available after DU aborts.

Guiding hint from misconfigured_param: nr_cellid = -1. In NR, the cell identity is 36 bits. Setting -1 would be interpreted as an unsigned value with all bits set, which violates the 36-bit constraint and triggers an assertion when composing SIB1.

Network config parsing highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs.nr_cellid = 1 (valid)
- du_conf.gNBs[0] lacks an explicit `nr_cellid` field in the provided JSON, but logs indicate a failure that exactly matches using -1 for the NR cell ID during SIB1 build.
- du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon[0].physCellId = 0, band/numerology consistent with logs (n78, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106). UE RF aligns to 3619200000 Hz.

Initial mismatch: The asserted failure in DU logs shows a 36-bit size check on cellID with value 18446744073709551615, i.e., UINT64_MAX, which comes from configuring -1. This contradicts the valid `nr_cellid=1` present in cu_conf and points to a DU-side misconfiguration for `nr_cellid`.

Expected flow: CU brings up NGAP and F1AP → DU brings up F1-C and starts rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim, performs cell search/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session. Here, DU crashes early, so UE cannot connect to rfsim.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGAP setup request/response successful to AMF at `192.168.8.43`/port 2152. F1AP starts and SCTP socket is created for `127.0.0.5`.
- CU-UP acceptance and GTPU instances created. No fatal errors. CU waits for DU over F1.
- No anomalies besides absence of further F1AP activity, consistent with a DU crash before full F1 setup.

Cross-reference: CU `gNB_ID 0xe00`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`, NG interfaces consistent with `NETWORK_INTERFACES` in cu_conf. Nothing in CU suggests misconfiguration pertaining to cell identity.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes NR PHY/MAC/RRC with TDD config and frequencies consistent with config: band 78, DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106. SIB1 scheduling and timers printed. PCI from config is 0.
- Hard failure:
  - Assertion (cellID < (1l << 36)) failed!
  - In get_SIB1_NR() .../nr_rrc_config.c:2493
  - cellID must fit within 36 bits, but is 18446744073709551615
  - Exiting execution
- This is the RRC building SIB1 with `nr-CellIdentity` outside allowed range. Value UINT64_MAX corresponds to -1 in signed space, matching misconfigured_param.
- Post-crash messages show repeated config section reads and final assert exit.

Link to network_config: DU JSON provided does not show `nr_cellid`, but OAI DU config supports it; if set to -1 in the actual DU config file, it would cause exactly this assertion during SIB1 build.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with matching RF settings (3619200000 Hz, SCS 30 kHz).
- Repeated attempts to connect to rfsimulator at 127.0.0.1:4043 fail with errno 111 (connection refused).
- Correlation: DU, which acts as the rfsim server, has crashed before opening the server socket; hence UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU crashes in RRC SIB1 generation due to invalid `nr_cellid` (set to -1) → rfsim server never starts → UE connection attempts fail. CU never progresses to stable F1AP DU association.
- Root cause: Invalid `nr_cellid=-1` in the DU configuration. In NR, `nr-CellIdentity` is a 36-bit value. Using -1 results in `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`, violating the check `cellID < (1 << 36)` in `get_SIB1_NR()`.
- Consistency note: CU has `nr_cellid=1`, which is valid. DU should use a valid non-negative value within 0..(2^36-1), and ideally align with PCI relation if desired. The immediate fix is to set a valid `nr_cellid` in DU (e.g., 1) and avoid negative values.

Standards and OAI references (knowledge-based):
- 3GPP TS 38.331 defines `nr-CellIdentity` with size 36 bits.
- OAI RRC `get_SIB1_NR()` composes SIB1 and checks the range (as seen in the assertion).

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix: Set DU `nr_cellid` to a valid 36-bit non-negative value. To match CU, use 1. Optionally, set `physCellId` to 1 for alignment, though it is not mandatory for the fix of the crash.
- Validate: After change, DU should pass SIB1 build, rfsim server should start, UE should connect, and random access can proceed.
- Additional checks:
  - Ensure DU `rfsimulator.serveraddr` is `server` (default) and UE points to 127.0.0.1:4043; with DU up, UE connects.
  - Keep band/SCS/N_RB consistent (already aligned).

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON within the existing structures; comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "gNB_ID": "0xe00",
        "gNB_DU_ID": "0xe00",
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-DU",
        "nr_cellid": 1, // FIX: was -1; must be 0..2^36-1
        "servingCellConfigCommon": [
          {
            "physCellId": 1 // Optional alignment with nr_cellid; previously 0
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "nr_cellid": 1 // Already valid; keep unchanged
    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No change needed for this issue
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update the DU config file to remove any `nr_cellid = -1` and set to 1.
- Restart DU; verify that the assertion is gone and rfsim server listens on 4043.
- Start UE; confirm successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, cell search, SIB decode, and RA.

## 7. Limitations
- The provided DU JSON lacks an explicit `nr_cellid` field; the logs conclusively show the failing value as if `-1` had been set in the DU config used at runtime. The correction is still valid and necessary.
- Timestamps are not included; correlation is based on sequence and known OAI behavior.
- This analysis relies on 3GPP NR cell identity size (36 bits) and OAI RRC assertions; deeper code line references are inferred from the log message path.
