## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The system is running OAI in SA mode over `rfsim` (seen in CU/DU/UE logs showing "--rfsim --sa"). Expected high-level flow: initialize CU/DU → CU <-> AMF over NGAP → F1AP CU-DU association → DU brings up radio (TDD config, PRACH, SSB, SIB1) → UE connects to RF simulator server → cell search/SSB → PRACH RA → RRC → PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: **plmn_list[0].mcc=001A**. MCC must be 3 decimal digits per 3GPP TS 23.003; any non-decimal character invalidates it.
- Network config summary and alignment:
  - CU `plmn_list`: `mcc=1, mnc=1, mnc_length=2` (interprets as MCC 001, MNC 01) → valid.
  - DU `plmn_list`: in the provided JSON, `mnc` present but `mcc` missing; however, DU runtime logs clearly validate `mcc` and report invalid value, so the actual DU config file used at run time contained `mcc` with a wrong value (matching the misconfigured parameter).
  - UE IMSI: `001010000000001` → MCC 001, MNC 01, which must match CU/DU PLMN.
- Initial mismatch spotted: DU's MCC value is malformed ("001A"). The CU is fine. With DU failing early due to config checks, UE cannot connect to the RF simulator server hosted by the DU.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU initializes in SA mode, sets up NGAP, and successfully registers with AMF:
  - "Send NGSetupRequest" → "Received NGSetupResponse" → CU application receives NGAP_REGISTER_GNB_CNF (associated AMF 1).
  - GTP-U configured on `192.168.8.43:2152` as per `NETWORK_INTERFACES` in `cu_conf`.
- CU starts F1AP and creates the SCTP socket toward DU: "F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5" (local) which aligns with CU `local_s_address=127.0.0.5` and DU `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5`.
- No explicit anomaly in CU; rather, CU appears to wait for DU establishment. The absence of subsequent F1AP association completion suggests DU has not brought up its F1 endpoint.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/TDD and parses serving cell config (band n78, SSB at 3.6192 GHz, 106 PRBs, numerology μ=1). All physical parameters look coherent.
- Critical failure during config validation:
  - `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: mcc: 1000 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999`
  - `[ENB_APP] [CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`
  - `... Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`
- Interpretation guided by misconfigured_param:
  - The DU's `plmn_list[0].mcc` is `001A`. As the parser attempts to interpret MCC as an integer, the non-digit 'A' likely corrupts parsing. The library reports value `1000`, which exceeds the valid range (0..999). Either the malformed string coerces to 1000 or the parse path transforms the invalid token into this boundary-breaching integer.
  - This triggers `config_execcheck` and a fatal exit before F1AP can establish with the CU or the RF simulator server can accept UE connections.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes in SA mode, configures RF for 3.6192 GHz, μ=1, N_RB=106, matching DU/CU RF parameters.
- Repeated failures to connect to the rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)` (connection refused): this indicates the server side (DU rfsimulator) is not up/listening.
- This aligns with the DU process crashing during config validation, so the RF simulator server is never started.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU successfully completes NG setup with AMF and starts F1AP → waiting for DU.
  - DU crashes early during configuration check due to invalid MCC in `plmn_list`.
  - UE, acting as rfsim client, cannot connect to the server (DU), repeatedly getting connection refused.
- Root cause (guided by the provided misconfiguration): **DU `plmn_list[0].mcc=001A` is invalid**. MCC must be numeric digits (0-9), 0..999. The invalid character causes the DU configuration checker to reject the configuration and exit.
- Spec basis and OAI behavior:
  - 3GPP TS 23.003 defines MCC as 3 decimal digits. OAI expects MCC in [0..999] and validates via `config_check_intrange` in its configuration framework. Non-numeric strings are not permitted.
- Secondary effects:
  - Because DU exits, F1AP association never completes, and the RF simulator server is never created, causing UE connection refusals.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix: Set DU MCC to a valid numeric value matching CU and UE IMSI. Given UE IMSI `001010...` and CU `mcc=1 (001), mnc=1 (01)`, set DU `plmn_list[0].mcc=1` and keep `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2`.
- Verify PLMN alignment across all components after the change and re-run.
- Optional validations:
  - Ensure the DU actually loads the corrected config file (path in DU log shows `.../error_conf/du_case_03.conf`).
  - Confirm F1AP association completes in logs and that UE can connect to rfsim server.

Corrected snippets within the provided `network_config` structure (comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "plmn_list": [
          {
            // FIX: provide numeric MCC matching CU/UE (001 → integer 1)
            "mcc": 1,
            "mnc": 1,
            "mnc_length": 2,
            "snssaiList": [
              { "sst": 1, "sd": "0x010203" }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "plmn_list": {
        // Already correct: MCC 1 (001), MNC 1 (01), 2-digit MNC
        "mcc": 1,
        "mnc": 1,
        "mnc_length": 2,
        "snssaiList": { "sst": 1 }
      }
    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "uicc0": {
      // IMSI 001-01-0000000001 → matches MCC 001, MNC 01
      "imsi": "001010000000001"
    }
  }
}
```

- After applying the fix, expected behavior:
  - DU passes config checks, brings up RF simulator, and completes F1AP association with CU.
  - UE connects to `127.0.0.1:4043`, proceeds with cell search/SSB decode, PRACH RA, RRC, and PDU session establishment.


## 7. Limitations

- The DU config JSON shown in the input omits `mcc` under `plmn_list`, but the DU runtime logs clearly validate and reject an `mcc` value; diagnosis relies on logs plus the provided misconfigured parameter to reconstruct the actual file content.
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps, so precise temporal sequencing is inferred.
- The exact parser pathway turning `001A` into `1000` in the error message is not detailed here; what matters is that any non-numeric MCC violates the allowed integer range and is rejected by OAI's config checks.
