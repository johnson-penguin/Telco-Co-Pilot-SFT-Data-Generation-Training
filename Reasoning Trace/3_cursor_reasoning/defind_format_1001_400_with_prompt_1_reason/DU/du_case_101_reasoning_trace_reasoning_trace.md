## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. CU is in SA mode, brings up NGAP with AMF and starts F1AP. DU should initialize PHY/MAC/RRC and start the rfsimulator server (listening on 4043). UE attempts to connect to that rfsim server.

Guided by misconfigured_param: rfsimulator.modelname=None. OAI’s DU config is parsed by libconfig; non-string or malformed values (e.g., unquoted None) can cause a syntax error, preventing the configuration module from loading and aborting the process before any radio stack brings up the simulator server.

Network_config highlights relevant to rfsimulator:
- du_conf.rfsimulator.modelname should be a valid string (e.g., "AWGN"). In this error case, the actual DU .conf used at runtime had `modelname=None`, causing a parse failure. The JSON extract shows a correct value ("AWGN"), which indicates the generated/expected config is fine but the runtime file deviated.
- All other DU parameters (band n78, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106) are typical and not implicated by the current failure.

Expected flow: CU up (NGAP/F1AP) → DU loads config via libconfig, starts MAC/RRC and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim, decodes SIB, performs RA → RRC attach and PDU session. Here, DU aborts at configuration parsing, so rfsim server never starts and UE cannot connect.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGSetupRequest/Response successful; CU starts F1AP and creates sockets on 127.0.0.5.
- CU shows no fatal errors and waits for DU over F1.
- Lack of subsequent F1AP DU association events matches an early DU failure.

Cross-reference: CU interfaces and IDs match `NETWORK_INTERFACES`. Nothing CU-side is affected by the simulator model name.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- libconfig reports: `syntax error` at a specific line in the DU config file.
- Then: `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`, followed by multiple `config_get ... skipped, config module not properly initialized` and `LOG init aborted`.
- Finally: `Getting configuration failed` and the process exits. Return code from `config_libconfig_init` is -1.
- Interpretation: The DU never loads configuration due to a parse error. Given the misconfigured_param, `rfsimulator.modelname=None` is the offending token (should be a quoted string). Because configuration is not available, MAC/RRC/PHY are never initialized and the rfsim server socket is never created.

Link to network_config: The provided JSON shows `"modelname": "AWGN"` (valid); however, the error-case DU config file used at runtime differs (contained `None`), as evidenced by the libconfig parse failure.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE would typically initialize RF and then attempt to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043. With DU aborted pre-start, UE would see errno 111 (connection refused) repeatedly.
- Even if UE RF parameters match, it cannot proceed to SIB decode or RA without the DU’s rfsim server.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU fails to parse config due to `modelname=None` → configuration module not initialized → DU exits → UE cannot connect to rfsim → CU sees no DU association.
- Root cause: Invalid rfsimulator model name syntax/value. In libconfig syntax, strings must be quoted and the value must be one of the supported models (e.g., "AWGN"). Using `None` (unquoted identifier) yields a syntax error and aborts configuration loading.
- Context: This is a configuration parsing failure, not a radio parameter mismatch. Fixing the syntax restores normal DU startup.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix the DU rfsimulator model configuration:
  - Set `modelname` to a valid quoted string (e.g., "AWGN").
  - Ensure the DU .conf file has correct libconfig syntax (commas, semicolons, quotes).
- Validate after change:
  - DU should successfully load config, start MAC/RRC, and listen on 4043.
  - UE should connect, decode SIB, and proceed to RA/RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - Keep `rfsimulator.serveraddr` as `server` (default) and verify `serverport` 4043.
  - Confirm no other parameters have malformed values (e.g., missing quotes or trailing commas).

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON with comments indicating changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "server",
      "serverport": 4043,
      "options": [],
      "modelname": "AWGN", // FIX: must be a quoted, valid model name (was None)
      "IQfile": "/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs"
    }
  },
  "cu_conf": {
    // No change required for this issue
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No change required for this issue
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Correct the DU config file to replace any `modelname=None` with `modelname="AWGN"` (or another supported model) and ensure proper libconfig syntax.
- Restart DU; verify configuration loads and rfsim listens on 4043.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect succeeds, SIB decode, RA, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- The DU log does not echo the exact offending key/value; we infer `modelname=None` from the provided misconfigured_param and the parse error location.
- Timestamps are absent; sequencing is inferred from log order and known OAI startup behavior.
- Supported model names are implementation-defined; "AWGN" is a known valid default in OAI rfsimulator.
