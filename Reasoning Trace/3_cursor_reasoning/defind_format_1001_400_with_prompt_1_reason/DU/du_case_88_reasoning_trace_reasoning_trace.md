\n+## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We analyze an OAI 5G NR SA deployment with rfsim. Expected flow: CU init and NGAP with AMF → DU establishes F1 with CU and configures PHY/RU → DU broadcasts SSB → UE synchronizes (SSB), performs PRACH, RRC attach, PDU session. The misconfigured parameter is RU TX antenna count: `RUs[0].nb_tx=9999999`.

RU antenna counts must be supported by the RF driver (openair0) and consistent with logical antenna port usage. OAI enforces bounds (e.g., 0 < nb_tx ≤ 8) and validates that physical antennas are sufficient for configured `pdsch_AntennaPorts` topology.

Key parsed params:
- DU PHY: FR1 n78 at 3619.2 MHz, mu=1 (30 kHz), 106 PRBs, typical TDD pattern. Logical DL ports advertised: `pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2`, `N2=1` (from logs), `XP=2` → required DL ports = 2×1×2 = 4. UL ports `pusch_AntennaPorts=4`.
- RU: `nb_tx=9999999` (invalid, far above hardware limit), `local_rf=yes`, `do_precoding=0`.
- CU: F1/NGAP normal; UE: standard SA init, rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Initial mismatch: `nb_tx` exceeds supported range (openair0 typically supports up to 8). Even though 4 logical ports only require ≥4 TX chains, the upper-bound check will fail.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU runs SA, completes NGAP, starts F1AP; F1 Setup with DU is accepted. CU side is healthy.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC, TDD, and RF numerology; F1 Setup with CU completes; RU threads start.
- With `nb_tx=9999999`, OAI RU configuration is expected to assert on antenna bounds (analogous to `openair0 does not support more than 8 antennas`), causing termination soon after RU bring-up attempts. This prevents stable PHY operation and SSB.

Interpretation: An excessively large `nb_tx` violates RU device constraints and leads to an assertion during RU config (e.g., in `fill_rf_config`). F1 may briefly come up but the process won't reach a steady transmitting state.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE repeatedly tries to connect to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused). This is consistent with DU not maintaining the rfsim server due to RU configuration failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU healthy; DU unstable due to invalid `nb_tx`; UE cannot connect to rfsim. Root cause: `RUs[0].nb_tx=9999999` exceeds supported maximum and should be a small positive integer matching logical port needs (≥4) and ≤ 8.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Set `nb_tx` to a valid value supported by openair0 and aligned with logical ports — 4 is appropriate here; ensure `nb_rx` also matches UL ports (4). No change to PDSCH/PUSCH port config needed.

      // UE unchanged; requires DU to maintain RU/rfsim server and broadcast SSB
    }
  }
}
```

Post-fix expectations:
- DU passes RU antenna bound checks, rfsim server remains active, SSB is transmitted; UE connects and synchronizes, proceeding to PRACH and RRC.
- If issues persist: confirm no other antenna mismatches, verify `nb_tx ≤ 8` in the target OAI build, and ensure TDD pattern consistency for mu=1.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs provided do not explicitly show the antenna bound assertion for this case, but behavior is deduced from OAI constraints and analogous errors; the misconfigured parameter directly explains the instability.
