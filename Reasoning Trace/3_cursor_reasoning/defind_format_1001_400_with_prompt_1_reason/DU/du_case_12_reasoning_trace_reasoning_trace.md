## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. CU is in SA mode, brings up NGAP with AMF and starts F1AP. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC for TDD band n78 and starts the rfsimulator server (4043). UE acts as rfsim client to connect to the DU server.

Guided by misconfigured_param: RUs[0].nb_rx = invalid_string. In OAI configs, `nb_rx` must be an integer (number of physical RX antennas per RU). If provided as a non-numeric token/string, libconfig may coerce or default it (often to 1) rather than the intended value (e.g., 4). This can create RX antenna count mismatches and lead to reduced capability, incorrect RF channel setup, or later instability, even if the system does not assert at startup.

Network_config highlights relevant to RU/RF channels:
- DU Target: n78, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106, typical for 3.6192 GHz. PDSCH ports suggest XP=2, N1=2, N2=1; `maxMIMO_layers=1`.
- RU misconfiguration: `nb_rx` typed incorrectly. DU log shows it running with NB_RX 1 and NB_TX 4, indicating `nb_rx` was parsed as 1, not the intended higher value.
- CU network interfaces and DU/CU loopback F1 settings are consistent; not directly impacted by `nb_rx` typing.

Expected flow: CU up (NGAP/F1AP) → DU up (MAC/RRC configured, rfsim server active) → UE connects to rfsim, decodes SIB, performs RA → RRC attach and PDU session. Here, DU reaches F1 setup and starts the rfsim server, but CU later observes SCTP shutdown; UE repeatedly fails to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043. The mis-typed `nb_rx` likely caused DU to initialize with only 1 RX chain, which can break expected RF channel setup and contribute to instability; however, the immediate observable failures (UE rfsim connect, CU SCTP shutdown) are transport-level symptoms of the DU not remaining in a healthy operational state.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGSetupRequest/Response successful; F1AP started; CU accepts DU (F1 Setup Response exchanged) and marks cell in service.
- Shortly after, CU receives SCTP SHUTDOWN EVENT and tears down the DU association. This indicates the DU closed the F1 association or crashed/exited its F1 task after initial setup.
- No NGAP issues otherwise; CU was ready and waiting for a stable DU.

Cross-reference: CU addresses (127.0.0.5 for CU, 127.0.0.3 for DU) align with configs.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU completes MAC/RRC init; F1-C connects to CU; GTP-U instance is created; MAC receives F1 Setup Response and Configuration Update Acknowledge — so early control-plane bring-up succeeded.
- RU/PHY initialization reveals:
  - “Setting RF config for N_RB 106, NB_RX 1, NB_TX 4” — NB_RX is 1, which suggests the invalid string was parsed to a default 1.
  - DU starts rfsimulator as server and reports RU and RF started.
- Despite initial success, CU then logs SCTP shutdown; DU log shows continued RU activity, but overall system is unstable. Under-provisioned NB_RX can lead to incorrect RF channel allocation and mismatches with higher-layer expectations, increasing the chance of runtime issues.

Link to misconfiguration: The provided parameter explicitly states `nb_rx=invalid_string`. The observed NB_RX 1 confirms an unintended value was used.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with RF consistent with DU (3619200000 Hz, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs).
- It repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 but gets errno 111 (connection refused). Given DU reported running as rfsim server, this suggests DU did not keep the server listening (process instability) or transient failures occurred around the time CU tore down F1.
- With DU unstable, UE cannot proceed to SIB decode or RA.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU up, F1 setup succeeds → RU starts with NB_RX=1 due to mis-typed `nb_rx` → system becomes unstable (CU sees SCTP shutdown; UE cannot connect to rfsim) → no progress to UE attach.
- Root cause: `RUs[0].nb_rx` must be a valid integer matching intended hardware/simulator channels. A non-numeric value made DU operate with NB_RX=1, leading to an RF channel configuration that is inconsistent with the broader configuration and causing runtime instability and transport teardown.
- Context: OAI’s RU configuration expects strict typing; while some values are coerced at parse time, mismatches often surface later as liveness or transport failures rather than immediate assertions.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix RU RX antenna configuration:
  - Set `RUs[0].nb_rx` to a valid integer (e.g., 4) to match the intended RX chain count and align with TX chains if required.
  - Ensure libconfig typing is correct (integers without quotes) and that RU-to-gNB antenna mappings are coherent.
- Validate after change:
  - DU should maintain stable F1 association (no SCTP shutdown) and keep rfsim server listening on 4043.
  - UE should connect, decode SIB, perform RA, and proceed to RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - Verify `RUs[0].nb_tx` and `pdsch_AntennaPorts_*` remain consistent with `maxMIMO_layers`.
  - Inspect DU runtime logs for any residual RF warnings; confirm UE can complete RA.

Operational steps:
- Correct `nb_rx` to an integer value (e.g., 4) and restart DU. Confirm F1 remains up and rfsim server is listening on 4043.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect, SIB decode, RA, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- The exact parser behavior for non-numeric `nb_rx` is implementation-dependent; here logs indicate a fallback to 1. Root-cause remains the mis-typed field.
- SCTP shutdown origin is not explicitly shown on DU side; correlation is based on CU’s event timing and DU’s unstable rfsim service as seen by UE.
- Timestamps are not included; sequencing inferred from log order and typical OAI behavior.
