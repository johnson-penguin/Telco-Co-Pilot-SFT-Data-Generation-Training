## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA using rfsimulator. CU runs in SA mode and completes NGAP setup; F1AP is started. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC for n78 with SCS 30 kHz and should start the rfsim server (4043). UE attempts to connect to the rfsim server.

Guided by misconfigured_param: preambleTransMax = 11. In NR, rach-ConfigCommon.preambleTransMax is an ASN.1 enumerated type (per 3GPP TS 38.331/38.321), allowing specific values like n3, n4, n5, n6, n7, n8, n10, n20, n50, n100, n200. The literal numeric 11 is not a valid enumerant and will break ASN.1 encoding of RACH-ConfigCommon.

Network_config key points:
- DU ServingCellConfigCommon: band n78, ABSFREQSSB ≈ 3619.2 MHz, SCS 30 kHz, DL/UL 106 PRBs.
- prach_ConfigurationIndex = 98 (valid for mu=1), msg1_SubcarrierSpacing = 1 (30 kHz), other PRACH fields coherent.
- preambleTransMax is set to 11 (invalid enumerant), which will cause RRC encoding failure.
- CU networking and UE RF align with DU; problem is within DU’s RACH config encoding.

Expected flow: CU up (NGAP/F1AP) → DU up (RRC encodes SIB1/ServingCellConfigCommon) → rfsim server active → UE connects, decodes SIB, performs PRACH → RRC attach. Here, DU aborts while encoding RACH-ConfigCommon, so rfsim never reaches a stable state and UE cannot proceed.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGSetupRequest/Response successful; F1AP started; CU shows no fatal errors.
- CU waits for DU; lack of further DU association events is consistent with a DU-side abort.
- Nothing in CU relates to RACH enumerants; networking is fine.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Normal n78 initialization lines (TDD, PRB, numerology) are printed.
- Two RACH-related failures are typical depending on the exact bad field; in this case we see the ASN.1 encoding failure:
  - Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed!
  - In clone_rach_configcommon() .../nr_rrc_config.c:130
  - could not clone NR_RACH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding
  - Exits immediately.
- Interpretation: While building the NR_RACH_ConfigCommon for SIB/ServingCellConfigCommon, ASN.1 encoding fails because preambleTransMax does not map to a valid ASN.1 enumerant. OAI aborts to avoid emitting an invalid SIB.

Link to network_config: `preambleTransMax: 11` is the sole offending field; other RACH parameters (index 98, msg1 SCS 30 kHz, ZCZC 13) are used commonly and are valid in OAI examples.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with RF matching DU (3619200000 Hz, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs).
- UE repeatedly attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and sees errno 111 (connection refused) because DU aborts before keeping the rfsim server listening.
- Without a stable DU, UE cannot decode SIB or perform PRACH.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU parses SCC → RRC attempts to encode RACH-ConfigCommon → invalid enumerant (preambleTransMax=11) causes encoding assert → DU exits → UE connection attempts fail; CU sees no DU association.
- Root cause: `preambleTransMax=11` is not a valid NR enumerated value. Valid values are n3, n4, n5, n6, n7, n8, n10, n20, n50, n100, n200 (OAI maps these to integers symbolically). Using 11 breaks ASN.1 encoding.
- Standards/context: 3GPP TS 38.331 specifies RACH-ConfigCommon and the allowed enumerants; OAI mirrors this in its ASN.1 codec generation and runtime checks.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix DU RACH configuration:
  - Set `preambleTransMax` to a valid enumerant; e.g., use 6 (maps to n6) or 8 (n8). OAI example configs often use 6.
  - Keep `prach_ConfigurationIndex` at a valid value for mu=1 (e.g., 98) and `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing` at 1 (30 kHz).
- Validate after change:
  - DU should pass ASN.1 encoding of RACH-ConfigCommon, complete MAC/RRC setup, and start rfsim server on 4043.
  - UE should connect, decode SIB, perform PRACH (Msg1/Msg2), and proceed to RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - If PRACH format/timing is modified, re-verify against 38.211 tables and OAI’s constraints.

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON with comments indicating changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "servingCellConfigCommon": [
          {
            "prach_ConfigurationIndex": 98,
            "msg1_SubcarrierSpacing": 1,
            "preambleTransMax": 6 // FIX: was 11 (invalid); set to valid enumerant (n6)
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "cu_conf": {
    // No change required for this issue
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No change required for this issue
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update DU config to set `preambleTransMax = 6` (or another valid enumerant mapping).
- Restart DU; confirm no assert in `clone_rach_configcommon()` and that rfsim listens on 4043.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect succeeds, SIB decode, PRACH succeeds, and RRC connection proceeds.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs do not echo the invalid value; the assertion location and provided misconfigured_param identify the cause.
- Valid enumerants are constrained by ASN.1; different OAI versions may render them as symbolic names in text configs, but the JSON mapping should reflect the same set.
