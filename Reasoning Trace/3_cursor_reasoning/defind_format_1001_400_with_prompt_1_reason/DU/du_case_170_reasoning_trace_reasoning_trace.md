## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

The setup runs OAI 5G NR in SA mode with rfsimulator, using a split CU/DU architecture over F1. Expected flow: components initialize → CU establishes NGAP to AMF → DU and CU complete F1 setup → DU brings up RU/L1 and starts rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server, scans SSB, performs PRACH/RA, RRC attach, PDU session. The provided misconfigured parameter is: RUs[0].nb_rx = -1.

From network_config:
- CU: `tr_s_preference = "f1"`, NG interfaces bound to `192.168.8.43`, AMF `192.168.70.132` (CU logs show NGAP works). F1 CU address `127.0.0.5`.
- DU: F1 DU at `127.0.0.3` connects to CU `127.0.0.5`. `servingCellConfigCommon` indicates band n78 style values but DU logs map to band 48 at 3619.2 MHz; consistent across DU and UE. rfsimulator configured with `serveraddr = "server"`, so DU should act as rfsim server on port 4043.
- RU block: `nb_tx = 4`, `nb_rx = -1` (invalid). OAI asserts `ru->nb_rx > 0 && ru->nb_rx <= 8`.
- UE: IMSI etc. RF params inferred from logs: DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106.

Initial mismatch: DU RU config has `nb_rx = -1`, which violates OAI RU constraints and will crash RU bring-up. This would terminate DU, drop F1 SCTP at CU, and prevent the rfsim server from listening—causing UE connection attempts to 127.0.0.1:4043 to fail with ECONNREFUSED.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- SA mode confirmed; GTPU configured for `192.168.8.43:2152`. NGAP setup proceeds: NGSetupRequest → NGSetupResponse from AMF. CU spawns F1 task and creates SCTP for `127.0.0.5`.
- F1AP: CU receives F1 Setup Request from DU, accepts, RRC version 17.3.0, cell in service.
- Shortly after, CU receives SCTP SHUTDOWN EVENT and removes F1 endpoint; releases DU 3584.

Interpretation: DU initially connects and completes F1 setup, then crashes or shuts down unexpectedly. This is consistent with a DU-side L1/RU assertion during RF configuration.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes MAC/PHY, configures TDD pattern and numerology (mu=1, N_RB=106). Frequencies: DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, band 48. SSB and PointA consistent with `servingCellConfigCommon`.
- DU confirms F1-C connection to CU, receives F1 Setup Response and configuration update.
- RU bring-up starts: "RU clock source set as internal", RU threads created, then assertion triggers:
  - Assertion (ru->nb_rx > 0 && ru->nb_rx <= 8) failed!
  - In fill_rf_config() ../../../executables/nr-ru.c:877
  - "openair0 does not support more than 8 antennas" (ancillary note; not core here)
  - Exiting execution.

Root of this trace: `nb_rx = -1` violates the guard and causes immediate exit during RU configuration, after F1 setup. This explains CU’s SCTP shutdown and all downstream symptoms.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes with matching RF params (DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106). UE prints "Initializing UE vars for gNB TXant 1, UE RXant 1" (fine).
- rfsimulator client attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly and fails with errno 111 (connection refused).

Interpretation: With DU crashed, no rfsim server listens on port 4043. Thus UE cannot connect; this is secondary to the DU RU config failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline: DU starts, completes F1 with CU, then RU config hits assertion because `RUs[0].nb_rx = -1` → process exits. CU observes SCTP shutdown; UE cannot connect to rfsim server (port 4043) since DU is down.
- The misconfigured parameter directly matches the DU log assertion. No additional spec lookup is required: OAI explicitly enforces `0 < nb_rx <= 8`. Given DU MAC earlier set RX antennas to 4, the intended `nb_rx` likely equals 4 to match `nb_tx = 4` and PUSCH/PUCCH assumptions.

Root cause: Invalid RU receive antenna count in DU configuration (`nb_rx = -1`) causing RU/L1 initialization failure and DU exit, cascading to CU F1 teardown and UE rfsim connection refusal.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Primary fix:
- Set `RUs[0].nb_rx` to a positive integer within [1..8], consistent with the hardware/simulation and DU MAC expectations. Based on logs showing DU MAC "Set RX antenna number to 4", set `nb_rx = 4`.

Secondary checks:
- Ensure `nb_tx` and `nb_rx` align with PDSCH/PUSCH antenna port settings and any beamforming/csi-rs plans (`pdsch_AntennaPorts_*`, `pusch_AntennaPorts`).
- After fixing, confirm DU stays up, CU retains F1 association, and UE connects to rfsim (127.0.0.1:4043) and proceeds to RA/RRC. If UE still fails to connect, verify DU indeed acts as rfsim server (`serveraddr = "server"`) and that port 4043 is listening.

Corrected network_config snippets (JSON with comments):

  "du_conf": {
    "RUs": [
      {
        "local_rf": "yes",
        "nb_tx": 4,
        "nb_rx": 4, // FIX: was -1, must be 1..8; set to 4 to match DU MAC
        "max_pdschReferenceSignalPower": -27,
        "max_rxgain": 114,
        "sf_extension": 0,
        "eNB_instances": [0],
        "clock_src": "internal",
        "ru_thread_core": 6,
        "sl_ahead": 5,
        "do_precoding": 0
      }
    ],
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "server",  // DU is rfsim server; UE connects as client
      "serverport": 4043,
      "options": [],
      "modelname": "AWGN",
      "IQfile": "/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs"
    }
  }
}
```

UE config generally looks fine for rfsim; no change required. If you run standalone UE on another host/container, ensure it targets the DU’s IP instead of loopback.

Operational validation steps:
- Restart DU with corrected config; confirm no RU assertion. Check DU log for "Listening on 0.0.0.0:4043" (or equivalent) from rfsimulator.
- Confirm CU retains F1 association (no SCTP shutdown). CU should show steady state after F1 setup.
- Start UE; verify successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, SSB detection, PRACH, RRC attach.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are partial and without explicit timestamps; analysis infers sequence from ordering. Specification citations are not strictly necessary because OAI log shows a direct assertion on `nb_rx`, but the general antenna limits are implementation-specific. If needed, inspect OAI source around `nr-ru.c:877` to confirm guard conditions in your specific commit.

Conclusion: The single misconfigured parameter `RUs[0].nb_rx = -1` in DU config causes the RU initialization assertion and cascades to CU F1 teardown and UE rfsim connection refusal. Setting `nb_rx` to a valid value (e.g., 4) resolves the issue.
