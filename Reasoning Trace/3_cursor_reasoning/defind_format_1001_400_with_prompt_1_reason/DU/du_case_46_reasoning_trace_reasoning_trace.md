\n+## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We analyze an OAI 5G NR SA deployment using rfsim. Nominal sequence: CU initializes and performs NGAP with AMF → DU establishes F1 with CU → DU PHY/RU configures RF and broadcasts SSB → UE synchronizes (SSB), performs PRACH, RRC attach, PDU session. We focus on transport-layer and addressing for F1-C/F1-U and GTP-U, as the misconfigured parameter indicates an IP issue in the DU’s `MACRLCs` section.

Guided by `misconfigured_param = "MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=999.999.0.1"`. This is an invalid IPv4 literal; any resolver (`getaddrinfo`) must fail. In OAI DU, `MACRLCs.local_n_address` is used for F1-C SCTP bind/connect and for GTP-U local bind. An invalid address should cause early failures in transport initialization, preventing F1-C association and GTP-U creation, which in turn blocks UE procedures and rfsim interactions depending on initialization order.

Key parsed params:
- DU `MACRLCs[0]`: `tr_n_preference="f1"`, `local_n_address=999.999.0.1` (invalid), `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5` (CU).
- DU `servingCellConfigCommon`: FR1 n78 at 3619.2 MHz, mu=1 (30 kHz numerology) — consistent with typical OAI configs. TDD pattern present and plausible.
- CU: NG/NGU at 192.168.8.43, F1 CU address 127.0.0.5, remote_s_address 127.0.0.3 (expected DU local).
- UE: standard SA RF init for 106 PRBs at 30 kHz; attempts to connect to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly fail (connection refused), suggesting DU server side never reached operational state.

Initial mismatch: DU attempts to bind/connect using `999.999.0.1`, which cannot resolve; this prevents F1 and GTP from coming up.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU runs SA, initializes NGAP, sends NGSetupRequest, receives NGSetupResponse; starts F1AP at CU.
- No F1 Setup exchanges are shown in this CU excerpt beyond start; CU appears ready but awaits DU association.
- Config cross-check: CU F1 listens on `127.0.0.5`; expects DU at `127.0.0.3`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes GNB/L1, parses serving cell; prints FR1 parameters; MAC config proceeds.
- Critical failure path when starting F1/transport with invalid address:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 999.999.0.1, ... binding GTP to 999.999.0.1`
  - `GTPU getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known`; `can't create GTP-U instance`
  - `Assertion (status == 0) failed! In sctp_handle_new_association_req()` due to `getaddrinfo(999.999.0.1)` failure
  - `Assertion (gtpInst > 0) failed! cannot create DU F1-U GTP module` and process exits.

Interpretation: Invalid `local_n_address` breaks both SCTP (F1-C) and UDP (GTP-U) setup. OAI asserts in SCTP task and F1AP DU task. As a result, DU terminates or at least does not provide F1/PHY services.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE configures RF and spawns threads; then repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused). This is expected if DU crashed before starting rfsim server or never reached RU server state due to earlier transport asserts.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU completes NGAP and is ready; DU fails during F1/transport init because of invalid IP. Without DU, no SSB is transmitted and rfsim server is not available; hence UE cannot connect and loops on connection attempts.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured param): `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=999.999.0.1` is an invalid IPv4 address. OAI uses it for local bind and for specifying F1-C and GTP-U endpoints, causing `getaddrinfo` failures and assertions. Correct local address must be a valid interface/IP reachable by CU (commonly `127.0.0.3` in rfsim single-host setups).

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Fix addressing to valid loopback consistent with CU expectations; ensure both F1-C (SCTP) and F1-U (GTP-U) bind to the DU loopback IP and peer to CU loopback IP:

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "MACRLCs": [
      {
        "tr_s_preference": "local_L1",
        "tr_n_preference": "f1",
        "local_n_address": "127.0.0.3",  // was 999.999.0.1 (invalid); use DU loopback
        "remote_n_address": "127.0.0.5", // CU loopback; matches CU config
        "local_n_portc": 500,
        "local_n_portd": 2152,
        "remote_n_portc": 501,
        "remote_n_portd": 2152
      }
    ]
  },
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
      "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3"  // peers with DU
    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "uicc0": {
      "imsi": "001010000000001"
      // UE networking unchanged; it only needs DU up and rfsim server listening
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after fix:
- DU should no longer assert in SCTP/GTP; F1 Setup with CU should complete (see DU MAC and CU RRC/F1AP logs).
- DU should progress to RU/rfsim server ready; UE should connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceed to SSB sync and PRACH.
- If still failing, verify the DU host has `127.0.0.3` configured (usual alias on loopback in OAI containers/scripts). If not present, use `127.0.0.1` for both ends and update CU accordingly, or add the alias.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; exact order between transport asserts and RF bring-up may vary by build. The presence of `getaddrinfo` and F1AP assertions conclusively indicates addressing root cause.
- The provided JSON abstracts only key fields; other networking sections (e.g., CU/DU multiple gNB instances) should be kept consistent if present.
