## 5G NR / OAI Reasoning Trace Generation

## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The deployment is OAI NR SA with rfsimulator, as shown by both CU/DU starting in SA mode and UE attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected sequence: CU initializes and connects to AMF (NGAP), DU initializes L1/MAC/PHY and exposes rfsim server, F1AP between CU/DU, UE connects to rfsim server, detects SSB, performs PRACH (Msg1), receives RA-RNTI response (Msg2), completes RA (Msg3/Msg4), proceeds with RRC setup and PDU session.
- The provided `misconfigured_param` is `ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR=9`.
  - 3GPP TS 38.331 defines `ssb-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB` as an enumerated choice with valid options: oneEighth, oneFourth, oneHalf, one, two, four, eight, sixteen → 8 values. Index 9 is invalid.
- Network configuration summary (relevant):
  - DU `servingCellConfigCommon[0]` includes:
    - `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280` → 3619200000 Hz (Band 78); `dl/ul_subcarrierSpacing=1` (μ=1), `dl/ul_carrierBandwidth=106` (20 MHz @ 30 kHz SCS), TDD pattern present.
    - PRACH-related: `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98`, `zeroCorrelationZoneConfig=13`, `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=1`, and the problematic `ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR=9` with `ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB=15`.
  - CU shows NG/GTU local addresses `192.168.8.43` and successfully exchanges NGSetup with AMF (so CU is healthy).
  - UE operates with DL/UL at 3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106, and tries rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Initial mismatch: The DU log asserts on `Unsupported ssb_perRACH_config 9` exactly matching the misconfigured parameter. This prevents DU from running, so the rfsim server is not available for UE; CU cannot establish F1 with DU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU initializes in SA mode, configures NGAP and GTP-U, and sends NGSetupRequest, receives NGSetupResponse — AMF connectivity is OK.
- CU starts F1AP and creates SCTP towards `127.0.0.5`. No subsequent F1AP association success is logged, suggesting DU never completes F1 setup.
- Cross-check with CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES`: `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/GU=192.168.8.43`, `GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=2152`. CU log lines align with these and show healthy GTP-U setup. No anomalies at CU beyond waiting for DU.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly: Band 78, μ=1, N_RB=106, TDD pattern computed and applied, SIB1 TDA, antenna ports, etc.
- Critical failure:
  - `Assertion (1 == 0) failed! In find_SSB_and_RO_available() ... Unsupported ssb_perRACH_config 9` → DU exits immediately.
  - This function computes SSB and PRACH RACH Occasion mapping; an invalid `ssb_perRACH_config` enum causes a hard assert in OAI.
- Therefore, DU does not reach a state where it listens on the rfsimulator server port, blocking UE connectivity and F1 establishment with CU.
- The asserted parameter exactly corresponds to the provided misconfiguration `ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR=9` in `servingCellConfigCommon[0]`.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for μ=1, N_RB=106 at 3619200000 Hz, consistent with DU.
- UE repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused), indicating no rfsim server is running.
- This is a downstream symptom of the DU crash; not a UE config problem. UE `ue_conf` provided only UICC parameters; rfsim client defaults are fine.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - DU crashes early due to invalid `ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR=9` → rfsim server never starts.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server (connection refused) and loops on connect attempts.
  - CU remains up and connected to AMF but never completes F1 with the DU.
- 3GPP/OAI context:
  - TS 38.331 restricts `ssb-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB` to the 8 enumerated values. OAI maps these to an internal `ssb_perRACH_config` enum. Any out-of-range value triggers the assert in `find_SSB_and_RO_available`.
- Root cause: Misconfigured DU parameter `ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR=9` (invalid enum index). This directly causes the DU assertion and exit.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix: Set `ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR` to a valid value per TS 38.331. Typical OAI defaults use values corresponding to "one" (full SSB per RACH occasion) or "oneHalf"; recommend using the common "one" selection.
  - Use a valid enum index (e.g., `3` for "one"). Keep `ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB` numeric consistent with the chosen enum and PRACH design. Other PRACH params (`prach_ConfigurationIndex=98`, `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=1`, `zeroCorrelationZoneConfig=13`) can remain unless there's a separate design change.
- After the change, validate that the DU completes initialization, starts rfsim server, UE connects, PRACH proceeds, and F1AP is established.
- Optional checks:
  - Verify CU AMF IP consistency; logs show successful NGSetup so this is not blocking.
  - Confirm SSB positions and PRACH occasion mapping in SIB1 via RRC logs if RA still fails.

- Corrected snippets (JSON within `network_config` structure; comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "servingCellConfigCommon": [
          {
            "ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR": 3,
            // Changed from invalid 9 → valid enum for "one" per TS 38.331
            "ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB": 15
            // Keep as configured; adjust only if RA design requires a different count
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "cu_conf": {
    // No change required for root cause; CU already reaches NGSetupResponse
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No change required; UE failure is due to DU crash (rfsim server not up)
  }
}
```

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated around F1AP events, but the DU assert and UE connection refusals are conclusive for root cause.
- The exact numeric mapping of the enum index to the ASN.1 choice may vary by implementation; using `3` for "one" matches common OAI defaults. Any valid enum in [0..7] would avoid the assert; choose per radio design.
- No timestamps are provided; sequence inferred from log order. If further issues persist post-fix, capture full DU RRC logs and SIB1 ASN.1 for PRACH fields to cross-check against TS 38.211/38.331.
