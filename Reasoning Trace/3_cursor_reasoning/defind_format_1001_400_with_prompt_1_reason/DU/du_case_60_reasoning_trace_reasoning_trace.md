\n+## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We analyze an OAI 5G NR SA deployment with rfsim. Expected flow: CU init and NGAP with AMF → F1 setup with DU → DU PHY/RU configured and SSB broadcast → UE sync to SSB, PRACH, RRC attach, PDU session. The misconfigured parameter targets the RU receive antenna configuration: `RUs[0].nb_rx=-1`. PHY/MAC bring-up depends on valid RU TX/RX chain counts consistent with logical antenna port usage.

From network_config: FR1 n78 at 3619.2 MHz, mu=1 (30 kHz), 106 PRBs, TDD pattern `dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity=6` with typical split (7 DL slots, 2 UL slots, partial-symbol guard). DL logical ports: `pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2`, `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2` (and N2=1 by log), so DL port requirement = 2×2×1=4; UL logical ports `pusch_AntennaPorts=4`. RU has `nb_tx=4` but `nb_rx=-1` (invalid).

Initial mismatches: RU `nb_rx` must satisfy 0 < nb_rx ≤ 8 (per OAI RU limits) and be ≥ `pusch_AntennaPorts` if one-to-one mapping is expected. Negative value violates both constraints.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU runs SA, completes NGAP (NGSetupRequest/Response), starts F1AP, receives DU F1 Setup Request/Response, then later logs SCTP shutdown/removal of the DU endpoint — consistent with the DU aborting afterward.
- CU networking and ports match the DU’s expected loopback setup.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU configures MAC/PHY, TDD patterns, and RF numerology (mu=1, 106 PRBs). F1 with CU establishes; GTP-U binds fine. RU threads start, then a fatal check occurs:
  - `Assertion (ru->nb_rx > 0 && ru->nb_rx <= 8) failed! In fill_rf_config()`
  - OAI exits. The RU receive chain count is invalid (`nb_rx=-1`).

Interpretation: The RU creation path validates antenna counts. With `nb_rx=-1`, RU configuration fails and the process exits, tearing down F1 (seen as SCTP shutdown at CU). Consequently, the DU never reliably transmits SSB nor serves UE.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for 30 kHz, 106 PRBs, then repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 with `errno(111)` (connection refused). This indicates the rfsim server isn’t available or is torn down due to DU failure — consistent with RU config assertion.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: F1 initially comes up, but RU configuration later fails due to invalid `nb_rx`, causing DU exit and CU to receive SCTP shutdown; UE cannot find the rfsim server and loops on connect attempts.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): `RUs[0].nb_rx=-1` violates RU antenna constraints and must be a positive integer ≤ 8. Given `pusch_AntennaPorts=4`, `nb_rx` should be at least 4.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Fix RU RX chain count to a valid value consistent with UL ports, typically 4 for this config. Keep `nb_tx=4` to match DL logical ports.

Corrected snippets within the network_config structure (comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "pusch_AntennaPorts": 4,
        "RUs": [
          {
            "local_rf": "yes",
            "nb_tx": 4,  // keep 4 to satisfy PDSCH ports (2*2*1)
            "nb_rx": 4,  // was -1; must be >0 and ≥ PUSCH ports (4)
            "do_precoding": 0
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "uicc0": {
      "imsi": "001010000000001"
      // UE unchanged; requires DU to complete RU bring-up and broadcast SSB
    }
  }
}
```

Post-fix expectations and checks:
- DU should pass `fill_rf_config` validations and remain stable; CU F1 remains established (no SCTP shutdown). RU/rfsim server active, SSB present; UE should connect and synchronize, then proceed to PRACH and RRC.
- If issues persist: verify no other antenna count mismatches, ensure `nb_rx ≤ 8`, confirm TDD pattern remains consistent with mu=1, and check rfsim connectivity.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; we infer N2=1 from DU prints. If PDSCH port configuration differs elsewhere, re-evaluate minimum `nb_tx` and `nb_rx` accordingly.
- Multi-cell/RU topologies may require ensuring each RU’s antenna counts and mappings are consistent with respective cell port settings.
