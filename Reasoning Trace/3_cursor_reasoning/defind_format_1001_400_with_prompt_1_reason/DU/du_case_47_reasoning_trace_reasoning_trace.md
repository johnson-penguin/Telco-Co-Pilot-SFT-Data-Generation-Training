\n+## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We analyze an OAI 5G NR SA deployment with rfsim. Expected flow: CU init and NGAP with AMF → DU establishes F1 with CU and configures PHY/RU → DU broadcasts SSB → UE synchronizes and performs PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session. The misconfigured parameter targets RU antenna configuration: `RUs[0].nb_tx=-1`. PHY/MAC initialization strongly depends on the number of physical TX/RX chains matching logical antenna port usage configured for PDSCH/PUSCH.

Key parsed DU params: `pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2`, `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2`, and (from logs) N2=1, implying logical DL ports required = 2×1×2 = 4. The RU block sets `nb_tx=-1` (invalid) with `local_rf=yes`, `do_precoding=0`. CU networking, numerology (mu=1, 30 kHz), and frequencies are otherwise standard for n78.

Initial mismatch: physical antenna count (`nb_tx`) must be a non-negative integer and at least the number of logical PDSCH ports; negative is invalid and < 4.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU initializes SA, NGAP is established (NGSetupRequest/Response). F1AP starts at CU. No CU-side errors. CU waits for DU F1 association and later UE contexts.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes GNB_APP and NR L1; configuration prints `pdsch_AntennaPorts N1 2 N2 1 XP 2`.
- Fatal assertion occurs in MAC/RLC configuration:
  - `Assertion (num_tx >= config.pdsch_AntennaPorts.XP * config.pdsch_AntennaPorts.N1 * config.pdsch_AntennaPorts.N2) failed!`
  - Message clarifies: logical antenna ports cannot exceed physical antennas (`nb_tx`). Since `nb_tx=-1`, the inequality fails (−1 < 4). OAI aborts in `RCconfig_nr_macrlc()`.

Interpretation: RU `nb_tx` is used to validate physical antenna availability before enabling the configured PDSCH port topology. A negative or too-small `nb_tx` trips the guard and exits early. Consequently, the DU never reaches rfsim server readiness nor SSB transmission.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE configures RF and threads, then continually tries to connect to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 with `errno(111)` (connection refused). This is downstream of the DU abort: the rfsim server is not running because DU exited during MAC/RLC config.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU is healthy and awaits DU; UE cannot connect to rfsim because DU never serves; DU aborts due to invalid physical antenna count.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured param): `RUs[0].nb_tx=-1` is invalid and violates the requirement `nb_tx ≥ PDSCH logical ports (XP×N1×N2)`. With ports 2×2×1=4, minimum `nb_tx` must be 4. Typically OAI rfsim examples use `nb_tx=4`, `nb_rx=4` to match this.
- UL path: `pusch_AntennaPorts=4` is consistent with `nb_rx=4`; ensure RX chains are sufficient as well.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Set a valid, sufficient antenna count and keep it consistent with logical ports. For this config, use 4 TX and 4 RX. No change needed to PDSCH/PUSCH ports if hardware (simulated) supports 4×4.

      "imsi": "001010000000001"
      // UE unchanged; DU must start and broadcast SSB after fix
    }
  }
}
```

Post-fix expectations:
- DU passes `RCconfig_nr_macrlc` validation, proceeds to start rfsim server, transmits SSB; UE connects and synchronizes, enabling PRACH and RRC.
- If further issues appear, verify that any other antenna-related settings (e.g., `maxMIMO_layers`, beamforming flags) align with 4×4 and that no other constraints (e.g., power or RU capability) are violated.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; we infer some defaults (e.g., N2=1) from DU prints. If PDSCH port settings differ elsewhere, recompute the required minimum `nb_tx` accordingly.
- Ensure that all gNB instances and RU mappings are consistent if multiple cells/RUs are configured.
