## 5G NR / OAI Reasoning Trace Generation

## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- OAI NR SA with rfsimulator: CU/DU start in SA mode; UE attempts TCP to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU ↔ AMF (NGAP) → CU starts F1AP → DU boots PHY/MAC and exposes rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim, detects SSB → PRACH/RA → RRC → PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter: rsrp_ThresholdSSB=-1.
  - In TS 38.331, rsrp-ThresholdSSB is an integer index with lower bound ≥ 0 (commonly 0..127). Negative is invalid and violates ASN.1 constraints.
- Network configuration highlights:
  - DU ServingCellConfigCommon: Band 78, μ=1, N_RB=106, PRACH cfgIndex 98, zeroCorrZone 13, msg1 SCS 30 kHz; includes rsrp_ThresholdSSB=-1.
  - CU has NG/GTU at 192.168.8.43 and successfully performs NGSetup with AMF.
  - UE operates at 3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106, and uses rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU initializes, configures GTP-U (addr 192.168.8.43:2152), sends NGSetupRequest and receives NGSetupResponse → AMF connectivity OK.
- CU starts F1AP and opens SCTP to 127.0.0.5; no later F1 association success is logged → DU likely exits early.
- CU config matches logs; no CU-side blocker observed.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU brings up PHY/MAC with correct band/SCS/BW, TDD pattern configured, SIB1 details logged.
- Crash point:
  - Assertion in clone_rach_configcommon() at nr_rrc_config.c:130: "could not clone NR_RACH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding" (enc_rval.encoded bounds assert).
  - This occurs during ASN.1 encoding of SIB1/ServingCellConfigCommon. An invalid rsrp_ThresholdSSB (-1) breaks ASN.1 constraints, causing encoder failure and the assert → DU exits.
- Outcome: rfsimulator server never starts; F1 with CU cannot be established.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes consistent RF params and repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- All attempts fail with errno(111) Connection refused → no rfsim server (DU crashed during RRC config build).
- UE configuration is fine; failures are downstream of the DU crash.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence correlation:
  - DU encodes SIB1/ServingCellConfigCommon → ASN.1 encoding fails due to out-of-range rsrp_ThresholdSSB=-1 → DU asserts and exits.
  - Without DU, rfsim server is absent → UE connect() fails repeatedly.
  - CU remains healthy with AMF but lacks DU to complete F1.
- Root cause: Invalid DU rsrp_ThresholdSSB=-1 in ServingCellConfigCommon violates TS 38.331 constraints, breaking ASN.1 encoding and triggering the DU assert.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Set rsrp_ThresholdSSB to a valid non-negative index per TS 38.331. A common OAI example value is 19 (implementation-specific mapping to dBm); any value within the allowed range (e.g., 0..127) is acceptable per design.
- Keep other PRACH/SSB parameters unchanged unless a separate design change is intended.
- After the fix: verify DU boots fully and listens on rfsim, UE connects, SSB detection proceeds, PRACH RA completes, and F1AP is established.

- Corrected snippets (JSON within network_config; comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "servingCellConfigCommon": [
          {
            "rsrp_ThresholdSSB": 19
            // Changed from invalid -1 → valid non-negative index per TS 38.331
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "cu_conf": {
    // No change needed; CU already completes NGSetup
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No change needed; UE failures stem from DU crash
  }
}
```

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated after F1 start; the precise assert location and UE connection refusals suffice to attribute failure to DU ASN.1 encoding.
- Exact rsrp index-to-dBm mapping is implementation-specific; choose a valid index matching coverage objectives.
- If issues persist post-fix, capture DU RRC ASN.1 dumps for SIB1 and cross-check PRACH/SSB fields against TS 38.211/38.331 to validate constraints.
