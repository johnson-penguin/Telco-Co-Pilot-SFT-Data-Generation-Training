## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The deployment is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator (logs show "--rfsim --sa"). Expected bring-up: CU initializes and registers to AMF (NGAP), DU initializes PHY/MAC and establishes F1-C with CU over SCTP, DU exposes rfsim server; UE connects to rfsim, acquires SSB/SIB1, performs PRACH/RA, RRC setup, and PDU session.
- Key guidance from misconfigured_param: **MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=999.999.999.999** (in `du_conf`). This is an invalid IPv4 address used by DU for its F1/NG-U local bind, expected to break name resolution/bind and abort DU early.
- Parse network_config highlights:
  - `cu_conf.gNBs`: `local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address=127.0.0.3`, NGU/NG AMF on `192.168.8.43`. CU is healthy and expects DU at 127.0.0.3.
  - `du_conf.MACRLCs[0]`: `local_n_address=999.999.999.999` (misconfigured), `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5` (CU). Ports align: DU control 500 ↔ CU remote 500, DU remote 501 ↔ CU local 501. PHY config shows band/numerology consistent with UE.
  - `du_conf.rfsimulator.serveraddr="server"`, `serverport=4043`: DU acts as rfsim server on localhost by default; UE will connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
  - `ue_conf`: SIM parameters only. No override for rfsim address; UE uses default 127.0.0.1.
- Initial mismatch: DU's invalid `local_n_address` conflicts with CU's expectation of DU at 127.0.0.3, leading to SCTP getaddrinfo/bind failure, preventing F1 setup and rfsim server startup; UE will then fail to connect to rfsim repeatedly.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA mode, registers to AMF successfully and starts F1AP:
  - NGSetupRequest → NGSetupResponse OK; GTP-U configured on 192.168.8.43:2152.
  - F1AP CU SCTP create socket for 127.0.0.5; CU expects DU remote at 127.0.0.3; no fatal errors shown afterwards.
- No anomalies on CU: it waits for DU F1 Setup. This aligns with a DU-side failure.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly (band 78, SCS µ=1, N_RB=106, TDD pattern, SIB1, etc.). Then F1AP at DU starts:
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 999.999.999.999, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 999.999.999.999".
  - Immediately: `Assertion (status == 0) failed! ... sctp_eNB_task.c:397 ... getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999) failed: Name or service not known` → process exits.
- This pinpoints the failure at SCTP association setup due to an invalid local address, fully consistent with the misconfigured parameter.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config matches DL/UL 3619.2 MHz, µ=1, N_RB=106. It repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused):
  - This indicates the rfsim server is not listening. In OAI, the DU typically hosts the rfsim server when `serveraddr="server"`. Since the DU aborted before networking initialization, the rfsim socket was never created.
- Thus, UE failures are a downstream symptom of the DU crash.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU up and registered to AMF → OK.
  - DU initializes PHY/MAC → OK; crashes at F1 SCTP bind on `999.999.999.999` → rfsim server never started.
  - UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim 127.0.0.1:4043 → expected because DU is down.
- Root cause: **Invalid DU local F1/NG-U IP `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=999.999.999.999`**. This breaks `getaddrinfo()`/bind for SCTP and GTP-U, triggers assertion in `sctp_eNB_task.c`, and prevents DU bring-up.
- Correct matching per configs:
  - CU expects DU control-plane endpoint at 127.0.0.3 (CU `remote_s_address`). Therefore DU must use `local_n_address=127.0.0.3` and `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5` to reach CU.
  - With a valid address, SCTP association (F1-C) will form; then DU will start rfsim and UE will connect.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Primary fix (DU): set a valid loopback address consistent with CU expectations.
  - Change `du_conf.MACRLCs[0].local_n_address` from `999.999.999.999` → `127.0.0.3`.
  - Keep `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5` to match CU `local_s_address` and ports (500/501) as already aligned.
- Optional validations:
  - Ensure OS has loopback route for 127.0.0.0/8 (default on Linux).
  - After change, verify DU logs show `F1AP SETUP REQUEST`/`SETUP RESPONSE` and that rfsim server starts (UE connects successfully).
  - Confirm GTP-U binds on a valid IP (127.0.0.3 or a real interface) and CU GTPU peer is reachable.
- Corrected network_config snippets (JSON with comments):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
        "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3"  // CU expects DU here; unchanged
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "MACRLCs": [
        {
          "local_n_address": "127.0.0.3",  // FIX: was 999.999.999.999; use valid IP matching CU remote
          "remote_n_address": "127.0.0.5",  // CU local_s_address; unchanged
          "local_n_portc": 500,
          "local_n_portd": 2152,
          "remote_n_portc": 501,
          "remote_n_portd": 2152
        }
      ],
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server",  // DU hosts rfsim server; UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- If F1 still does not establish after this change, check firewall rules for SCTP on loopback, and confirm no other process is bound to port 500/501.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not show full F1 Setup exchange on CU after socket creation; however, DU-side assertion with explicit `getaddrinfo()` failure on the invalid IP is conclusive.
- UE logs show only rfsim connection attempts; absence of RF layer interactions is expected since DU is down. No AS-level signaling to analyze.
- The analysis relies on known OAI control-plane topology (CU/DU over loopback in rfsim) and the explicit mismatch between `cu_conf` and `du_conf` addresses guided by the provided misconfigured parameter.
