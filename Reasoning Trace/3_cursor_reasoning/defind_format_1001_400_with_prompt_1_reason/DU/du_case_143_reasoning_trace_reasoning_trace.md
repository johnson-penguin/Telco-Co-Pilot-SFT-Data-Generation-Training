## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. CU is in SA mode, completes NGAP setup, and starts F1AP. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC for n78 with SCS 30 kHz. UE attempts to connect to the rfsim server (default 127.0.0.1:4043).

Guided by misconfigured_param: MACRLCs[0].local_n_address = "" (empty). OAI uses this field as the DU’s local bind address for F1-C/SCTP and the local address for GTP-U. An empty address string results in failed name resolution/bind (getaddrinfo), which aborts SCTP association and prevents GTP-U instance creation. Consequently, DU exits before rfsim server is stably available, and UE cannot connect.

Network_config highlights relevant to transport setup:
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].tr_n_preference = "f1"
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].local_n_address = "" (invalid/empty)
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address = 127.0.0.5 (CU), ports coherent
- Radio parameters (n78, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs) and PRACH settings look standard; not implicated by the transport failure.

Expected flow: CU up → DU binds local SCTP/GTP-U and connects to CU → rfsim server active → UE connects to rfsim, decodes SIB, performs PRACH → RRC attach. Here, DU fails at transport setup due to an empty local address and exits, so UE cannot connect and CU tears down the early association.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode and NGAP setup complete; CU starts F1AP and is ready.
- CU shows no configuration errors; it later receives SCTP shutdown and removes the DU endpoint in similar cases. In this trace, DU aborts before stable association, consistent with address errors on DU.

Cross-reference: CU addresses are 127.0.0.5 (CU) and expect DU at 127.0.0.3; CU is correctly configured.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Normal radio init lines, then transport failures linked to empty address fields:
  - F1AP DU prints: `F1-C DU IPaddr , connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to ` (both DU IP and GTP bind address are blank).
  - GTP-U: `Initializing UDP for local address  with port 2152` → `getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known` → "can't create GTP-U instance" (instance id -1).
  - SCTP: Assertion in `sctp_handle_new_association_req()` with `getaddrinfo() failed: Name or service not known`.
  - F1AP DU: Assertion `gtpInst > 0` failed in `F1AP_DU_task()` because F1-U GTP module cannot be created.
  - DU exits.
- Interpretation: Empty `local_n_address` propagates into transport setup strings, causing name resolution and bind failures for both SCTP and GTP-U, which aborts DU startup despite valid radio configuration.

Link to network_config: The provided DU config block explicitly sets `local_n_address` to an empty string, matching the blank addresses in logs and the subsequent failures.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes RF for n78 (3619.2 MHz, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs).
- UE repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and receives errno 111 (connection refused) because the DU exits before the rfsim server is stably listening.
- Without a running DU, UE cannot decode SIB or perform PRACH.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU with empty local address attempts transport setup → getaddrinfo fails for GTP-U and SCTP → F1-U creation fails → DU exits → UE cannot connect to rfsim; CU sees no persistent DU association.
- Root cause: `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=""` is invalid. DU must bind SCTP and GTP-U to a valid local IP/hostname (in rfsim examples, `127.0.0.3`). Empty string yields undefined/blank address in code paths and fails resolution.
- Context: This is a transport configuration error; radio parameters are otherwise consistent.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix DU local address:
  - Set `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address` to a valid IP, e.g., `127.0.0.3` (DU loopback in single-host rfsim setups).
  - Keep `remote_n_address` as `127.0.0.5` (CU loopback) and confirm CU’s `remote_s_address` is `127.0.0.3`.
- Validate after change:
  - DU should resolve/bind SCTP and GTP-U successfully; F1AP DU should associate to CU; rfsim server should be stable on 4043.
  - UE should connect, decode SIB, perform PRACH, and proceed to RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - Ensure no other fields are empty or malformed.
  - For multi-host deployments, replace loopbacks with reachable IPs and verify routing/firewall rules.

    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No change required for this issue
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update DU config to set a valid `local_n_address` (127.0.0.3). Restart DU and verify SCTP/GTP-U initialize without getaddrinfo errors; F1AP connects.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, SIB decode, PRACH, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs show empty address propagation but not the exact config line; misconfigured_param and DU logs make the cause explicit.
- Assumes single-host rfsim; adapt IPs for multi-host topologies.
- Timestamps are absent; sequencing inferred from log order and typical OAI behavior.
