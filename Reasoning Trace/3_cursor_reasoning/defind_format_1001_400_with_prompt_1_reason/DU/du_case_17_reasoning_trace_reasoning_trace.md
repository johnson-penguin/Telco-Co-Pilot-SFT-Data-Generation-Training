## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The setup runs OAI 5G NR in SA mode with RF simulator: CU/DU logs show "--rfsim --sa" behavior and standard initialization. Expected flow: CU NGAP setup with AMF → F1AP between CU/DU → DU brings up RF sim server → UE connects to RF sim → PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.
- CU logs: NGSetupRequest/Response succeed, CU proceeds to start F1AP; nothing blocking on CU side.
- DU logs: initializes PHY/MAC, configures TDD and bandwidth, then aborts with an assertion during RRC configuration encoding: clone_pucch_configcommon() → "could not clone NR_PUCCH_ConfigCommon".
- UE logs: repeatedly fail to connect to RF simulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043 (errno 111). This is consistent with DU aborting before starting RF simulator server.
- network_config parsing (key items):
  - du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon[0].hoppingId = 2048 (matches misconfigured_param). In 3GPP TS 38.331, PUCCH-ConfigCommon.hoppingId is constrained to 0..1023. Value 2048 is out-of-range and will cause ASN.1 encoding failure in OAI’s RRC generation.
  - PRACH: prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, zeroCorrelationZoneConfig=13, msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=1; frequencies: SSB absFrequency 641280 (~3619.2 MHz), DL/UL BW 106 RB, TDD pattern aligns with logs. No obvious inconsistencies besides hoppingId.

Conclusion of setup: The known misconfigured parameter hoppingId=2048 is present in DU config and is the primary suspect for the DU-side RRC encoding assert, which cascades to UE connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU SA mode, NGAP thread started, NGSetupRequest sent and NGSetupResponse received. GTP-U configured on 192.168.8.43:2152; CU-UP association accepted; F1AP at CU started.
- No CU anomalies: AMF connectivity OK; CU waits for DU over F1 SCTP (127.0.0.5↔127.0.0.3) after socket creation.
- Cross-ref with cu_conf: `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` = 192.168.8.43 matches logs; ports consistent. Nothing tied to PUCCH here; CU proceeds normally until DU side connects.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU SA mode, PHY/MAC init normal: BW 106 RB at 3619.2 MHz, TDD pattern derived and applied; SIB1 parameters printed; then:
  - Assertion failure: `enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)` in `clone_pucch_configcommon()` → "could not clone NR_PUCCH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding" → process exits.
- This precisely points to invalid PUCCH-ConfigCommon inputs used to build ServingCellConfigCommon/SIB. The out-of-range `hoppingId` causes PER encoding to fail (constraints violated), triggering the assert in OAI RRC code.
- Because the DU exits, it never brings up the RF simulator server, explaining UE connection failures.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY at the same numerology/BW/frequency, then tries to connect to RF simulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043 and repeatedly gets `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- This is consistent with the DU not running (server not listening) due to the PUCCH encoding assert and exit.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU ready → DU encodes RRC SIB/common configs → assert in PUCCH encoding → DU exits → RF sim server never starts → UE cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Misconfigured parameter: `hoppingId=2048` in DU’s `servingCellConfigCommon` is outside 3GPP bounds (0..1023). In OAI, RRC ASN.1 encoding enforces constraints and fails when violated, matching the assert in `clone_pucch_configcommon()`.
- Therefore, root cause is the invalid `hoppingId` in DU configuration causing RRC ASN.1 encoding failure and DU abort, cascading to UE connection failures and stalled system.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix: Set `hoppingId` to a valid integer in [0, 1023]. Any deterministic value is fine (e.g., 512). Rebuild/restart DU; verify RF simulator server starts, UE connects, and RA proceeds.
- Secondary checks:
  - Ensure CU/DU F1 SCTP addresses match (`127.0.0.5` CU, `127.0.0.3` DU) — they do.
  - Validate other PUCCH fields (e.g., `pucchGroupHopping`) remain consistent; current values look standard.
  - Observe DU logs for successful SIB1 encoding after fix.

{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "servingCellConfigCommon": [
            {
              "hoppingId": 512, // CHANGED from 2048 → valid 0..1023 per 38.331 PUCCH-ConfigCommon
              "pucchGroupHopping": 0 // unchanged; verify per deployment policy (0: neither/radio link monitoring compatible)
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "cu_conf": {
      // no changes needed for CU related to this issue
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // UE config OK; connection refused was due to DU crash
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update DU config, restart DU, confirm no assert and that RF sim server is listening on 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Start UE; expect successful TCP to RF sim, SSB detection, PRACH, RRC connection setup.
- If further failures: enable `Asn1_verbosity=annoying` and raise `rrc_log_level` to `debug` on DU to inspect RRC encoding.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps, so precise inter-component timing is inferred.
- Analysis hinges on 3GPP constraint for `hoppingId` (PUCCH-ConfigCommon, 0..1023). The assert location and misconfigured value align strongly with this root cause.
