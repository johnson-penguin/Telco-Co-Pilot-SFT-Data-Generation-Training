## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- System is OAI 5G NR in SA mode with RF simulator, as indicated by logs showing "--rfsim" and "--sa" and typical SA initialization lines.
- Expected bring-up flow:
  - CU initializes, registers to AMF over NGAP, starts F1AP listener for DU.
  - DU initializes PHY/MAC, loads TDD and cell params, establishes F1-C SCTP association to CU, and starts the RF simulator server.
  - UE initializes, connects to the RF simulator server, detects SSB, performs PRACH and completes RRC setup and PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter provided: MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address=999.999.999.999 (in DU). This is the DU-side F1-C destination address (CU control-plane IP). An invalid/unresolvable IP will break F1 setup.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- gNB (CU) config:
  - F1 split mode: `tr_s_preference: "f1"` with CU side `local_s_address: "127.0.0.5"`, `remote_s_address: "127.0.0.3"`.
  - NG interfaces toward AMF: `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/NGU: 192.168.8.43`.
  - CU logs confirm NGSetup success with AMF, and F1AP starts with a socket involving 127.0.0.5.
- gNB (DU) config:
  - DU uses F1 toward CU (`tr_n_preference: "f1"`).
  - DU local F1 address: `local_n_address: "127.0.0.3"` (this should be CU's `remote_s_address`).
  - DU remote F1 address (misconfigured): `remote_n_address: "999.999.999.999"` (should be CU's `local_s_address` 127.0.0.5).
  - RF simulator: `serveraddr: "server"` (DU acts as server listening on port 4043).
- UE config:
  - IMSI and credentials present; RF simulator client tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial mismatch summary:
- DU attempts to connect F1-C to an invalid CU IP (999.999.999.999) rather than the CU’s actual F1-C address (127.0.0.5). This should cause name resolution/connect failure at SCTP association setup, preventing DU bring-up and, transitively, preventing the RF simulator server from being available for the UE.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU initializes in SA mode, sets up NGAP and GTPU:
  - "Send NGSetupRequest to AMF" followed by "Received NGSetupResponse" confirms CU-AMF is healthy.
  - GTPU binds to 192.168.8.43:2152.
- CU starts F1AP:
  - "F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5" indicates CU listens/uses 127.0.0.5 for F1-C side.
- No log shows successful F1 Setup from DU; CU appears to be waiting for DU. There are no CU-side errors, implying the fault is on the DU path to CU.

Cross-check with CU config:
- `local_s_address: 127.0.0.5` (CU’s F1-C IP) matches CU logs.
- `remote_s_address: 127.0.0.3` (DU’s F1-C IP) is consistent and reachable within localhost if DU is up.

Conclusion for CU: CU is ready and waiting on F1; no NGAP issues; the problem is not on the CU’s side.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC and TDD config cleanly, indicating RF/PHY parameters are coherent (e.g., band 78, N_RB 106, TDD pattern, SIB1 settings). No PRACH/MAC parameter anomalies are reported.
- F1 bring-up line shows the misaddressing:
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 999.999.999.999" — this is the misconfigured destination for SCTP association.
- Immediate failure sequence:
  - Assertion at `sctp_handle_new_association_req()` with getaddrinfo() failure: "Name or service not known".
  - DU exits: "Exiting OAI softmodem: _Assert_Exit_".

Interpretation:
- `getaddrinfo()` on "999.999.999.999" fails because the string is neither a valid IPv4 literal nor a resolvable hostname, causing the DU to abort during SCTP association setup to the CU.
- Because the DU exits early, it never finishes starting the RF simulator server.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY for SA/TDD; hardware parameters align with DU configs (3619.2 MHz DL/UL, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106).
- UE runs as RF simulator client and attempts to connect repeatedly to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Repeated connection failures with errno(111) (connection refused) indicate no server listening on that port.

Correlation to DU state:
- The DU is configured to act as the RF simulator server (`serveraddr: "server"`), but since DU crashed on F1 setup, the server never bound to 4043. Hence the UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU: NGAP ready, F1AP waiting on 127.0.0.5.
  - DU: Crashes during F1-C association because remote CU address is invalid.
  - UE: Fails to connect to RF simulator server because DU never reached the point of starting it.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param):
  - `MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address=999.999.999.999` is invalid. It should point to the CU’s F1-C address (`cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address`), which is 127.0.0.5. Using an invalid address triggers getaddrinfo failure and aborts DU initialization.
- Secondary effects:
  - No F1 setup; no RF simulator server; UE cannot attach; overall system stalls at bring-up.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate config fix:
- Update DU to use the CU’s F1-C IP as its remote F1-C address: set `MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address` to `127.0.0.5` (matching `cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address`).
- Keep `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address` as `127.0.0.3` (matching `cu_conf.gNBs.remote_s_address`).

Post-fix expectations:
- DU will resolve/connect to CU on F1-C successfully; RF simulator server will start; UE’s client connects to 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceeds with SSB detection, PRACH, and RRC.

      }

        }
      ],

        "serveraddr": "server",
        "serverport": 4043

        "dnn": "oai",
        "nssai_sst": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational verification steps:
- Start CU, confirm NGSetupResponse received and F1AP listening on 127.0.0.5.
- Start DU; verify no SCTP assertion; look for F1 Setup success logs (F1AP SETUP REQUEST/RESPONSE exchange).
- Confirm DU logs show RF simulator server bound to 0.0.0.0:4043 or 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Start UE; confirm a successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, SSB detection, PRACH, RRC connection, and PDU session setup.

If issues persist:
- Validate that Windows networking/localhost is accessible if running via WSL/containers; ensure loopback is consistent.
- Ensure no port conflicts on 4043.
- Double-check that CU and DU use the same F1 SCTP ports (defaults are OK in given configs: CU portc 501, DU portc 500).

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are partial and lack explicit timestamps; only the key failure point is shown.
- No explicit F1AP success/failure lines from CU beyond socket creation; the conclusion relies on DU’s clear assertion and the provided misconfigured parameter.
- RF simulator binding logs from DU are not shown; the inference that the server never started is based on the DU crash and UE’s repeated connection refusals.
