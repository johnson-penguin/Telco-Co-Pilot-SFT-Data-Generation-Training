## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. CU is in SA mode, brings up NGAP with AMF and starts F1AP. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC for TDD band n78 and should start the rfsimulator server (4043). UE attempts to connect to that rfsim server.

Guided by misconfigured_param: RUs[0].nb_tx = invalid_string. OAI reads RU (radio unit) capabilities from the config; `nb_tx` must be an integer (number of physical TX antennas). If parsed as a non-integer (e.g., an unquoted token or a quoted non-numeric string depending on libconfig typing), OAI’s config layer may yield a default/zero/invalid value for `nb_tx`. Downstream, MAC/RLC configuration validates that the number of logical PDSCH antenna ports does not exceed the number of physical TX antennas, and an invalid/zero `nb_tx` will trigger an assertion.

Network_config highlights relevant to antennas and MIMO:
- DU shows `pdsch_AntennaPorts`: N1=2, N2=1, XP=2 (from logs), which implies at least 2 logical DL ports (cross-pol) and can imply up to 4 depending on mapping. `pusch_AntennaPorts` is 4. `maxMIMO_layers` is 1 (safe if physical antennas ≥ 1).
- Misconfiguration is specifically `RUs[0].nb_tx` being non-numeric; in correct configs, this is typically 1, 2, or 4 in rfsim examples.
- Other ServingCell parameters (n78, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs, PointA, ABSFREQSSB) are coherent with the UE.

Expected flow: CU up (NGAP/F1AP) → DU up (MAC/RRC configured, rfsim server active) → UE connects to rfsim, decodes SIB, performs RA → RRC attach and PDU session. Here, DU aborts during MAC/RLC config checks because `nb_tx` is invalid/zero relative to logical antenna ports; rfsim server never starts, so UE cannot connect.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGSetupRequest/Response successful; CU starts F1AP and creates sockets on 127.0.0.5.
- No fatal errors; CU waits for DU association. Absence of DU-side progress is consistent with an early DU abort.

Cross-reference with cu_conf: Interface IPs/ports match `NETWORK_INTERFACES`; unrelated to antenna validation.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU prints antenna ports: `pdsch_AntennaPorts N1 2 N2 1 XP 2 pusch_AntennaPorts 4`.
- Then hard failure:
  - Assertion (num_tx >= config.pdsch_AntennaPorts.XP * config.pdsch_AntennaPorts.N1 * config.pdsch_AntennaPorts.N2) failed!
  - In RCconfig_nr_macrlc() ../../../openair2/GNB_APP/gnb_config.c:1502
  - Number of logical antenna ports ... cannot be larger than physical antennas (nb_tx)
  - Exiting execution
- Interpretation: OAI computes required logical ports from N1/N2/XP (here at least 2, possibly more). With `nb_tx` invalid (parsed as 0/undefined), the check `num_tx >= (XP*N1*N2)` fails, causing the assertion and exit.

Link to network_config: The misconfigured `RUs[0].nb_tx` explains the mismatch; other RU fields (nb_rx, do_precoding) are present in typical configs but not shown here. Correcting `nb_tx` resolves the check.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with RF consistent with n78: SSB numerology 1 and N_RB_DL 106.
- It would try to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043; because DU exits before starting rfsim, UE sees errno 111 (connection refused) repeatedly.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU parses config where `nb_tx` is invalid → MAC/RLC validation compares required logical ports (from PDSCH N1/N2/XP) vs physical antennas → assertion → DU exit → UE cannot connect; CU sees no DU association.
- Root cause: `RUs[0].nb_tx` must be a valid integer ≥ required logical ports. Non-numeric/invalid value leads to `num_tx` being 0/undefined, violating `num_tx >= XP*N1*N2`.
- Context: This is a configuration typing/consistency error at the RU level, not a PHY parameter incompatibility per se.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix DU RU antenna settings:
  - Set `RUs[0].nb_tx` to a valid integer, e.g., 4 to comfortably cover XP=2, N1=2, N2=1 (logical requirement ≥ 2).
  - Ensure `RUs[0].nb_rx` is consistent (often 4 in examples) and `do_precoding` aligns with desired operation.
  - Keep `maxMIMO_layers = 1` unless end-to-end layers and antennas are increased coherently.
- Validate after change:
  - DU should pass `RCconfig_nr_macrlc` validation and start the rfsim server on 4043.
  - UE should connect, decode SIB, and proceed to RA/RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - If reducing PDSCH logical ports (e.g., XP=1, N1=1) for simplicity, ensure they do not exceed `nb_tx`.
  - Confirm RU section uses proper libconfig typing (integers without quotes for numeric fields).

Operational steps:
- Correct `nb_tx` to an integer (e.g., 4) and ensure RU config uses valid types/syntax.
- Restart DU; confirm no antenna-port assertions and that rfsim listens on 4043.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect succeeds, SIB decode, RA, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs do not show the parsed `nb_tx` value; inference is from the assertion and the provided misconfigured_param.
- Exact logical port mapping from N1/N2/XP is OAI-internal; the invariant checked is `nb_tx >= XP*N1*N2`.
- Timestamps are absent; sequencing inferred from log order and typical OAI startup behavior.
