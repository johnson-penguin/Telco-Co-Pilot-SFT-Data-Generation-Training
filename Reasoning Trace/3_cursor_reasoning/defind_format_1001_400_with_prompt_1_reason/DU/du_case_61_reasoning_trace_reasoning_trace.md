\n+## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We analyze an OAI 5G NR SA deployment with rfsim. Expected flow: CU init and NGAP with AMF → DU establishes F1 with CU and configures PHY/RU → DU broadcasts SSB → UE synchronizes (SSB), performs PRACH, RRC attach, PDU session. The misconfigured parameter is a DU transport address: `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=999.999.999.999`.

In OAI, `MACRLCs.local_n_address` is used for F1-C (SCTP) local bind/connect and for F1-U/GTP-U local bind. An invalid IPv4 literal guarantees resolver failure. Thus we expect early DU transport initialization errors, preventing F1 setup continuity and PHY bring-up. UE, being an rfsim client, will then fail to connect because the DU-side rfsim server never becomes operational or the process exits.

Key parsed params:
- DU `MACRLCs[0]`: `local_n_address=999.999.999.999` (invalid), `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5` (CU). Transport preference `tr_n_preference="f1"`.
- DU PHY config: FR1 n78 at 3619.2 MHz, mu=1 (30 kHz), 106 PRBs, standard TDD pattern; antenna ports indicate 4×4 MIMO capability (logical ports consistent with `nb_tx=4`, `nb_rx=4`).
- CU: F1 CU endpoint at `127.0.0.5`; expects DU peer at loopback (`127.0.0.3`).
- UE: standard SA init; rfsim client attempts to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU runs SA, sends NGSetupRequest and receives NGSetupResponse — NGAP is healthy.
- CU starts F1AP but shows no completed DU setup in this excerpt; CU is ready and awaits DU association.
- Networking matches expectations: CU binds at `127.0.0.5` for F1/GTU.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes GNB_APP/L1 and reads serving cell; TDD and numerology are printed normally.
- Critical failure occurs when starting F1/transport using the invalid local address:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 999.999.999.999 ... binding GTP to 999.999.999.999`
  - `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999) failed: Name or service not known`
  - `Assertion (status == 0) failed! In sctp_handle_new_association_req()` followed by process exit.

Interpretation: The DU cannot resolve/bind the provided local address for SCTP (F1-C) and UDP (GTP-U). OAI asserts in SCTP task and aborts F1AP DU task, so the DU terminates before PHY/rfsim service is available.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, receiving `errno(111)` (connection refused). This is expected because the DU aborted and is not running the rfsim server.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU is fully up on NGAP and idle on F1; DU aborts due to invalid `local_n_address`, preventing F1 association and PHY start; UE cannot connect to rfsim. The problem is entirely transport/addressing — not PHY/PRACH — as indicated by SCTP getaddrinfo failure and immediate asserts.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): `MACRLCs[0].local_n_address=999.999.999.999` is not a valid IPv4 address. It must be a resolvable/bindable interface IP, commonly `127.0.0.3` for the DU in single-host rfsim setups to pair with CU `127.0.0.5`.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Use a valid DU loopback IP that pairs with the CU’s configured peer. Align both SCTP (F1-C) and GTP-U endpoints. Typical OAI rfsim:

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "MACRLCs": [
      {
        "tr_s_preference": "local_L1",
        "tr_n_preference": "f1",
        "local_n_address": "127.0.0.3",  // was 999.999.999.999 (invalid)
        "remote_n_address": "127.0.0.5", // CU loopback
        "local_n_portc": 500,
        "local_n_portd": 2152,
        "remote_n_portc": 501,
        "remote_n_portd": 2152
      }
    ]
  },
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
      "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3"   // peers with DU
    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "uicc0": {
      "imsi": "001010000000001"
      // UE unchanged; requires DU to run rfsim and broadcast SSB
    }
  }
}
```

Post-fix validation:
- DU should no longer assert in `sctp_eNB_task` and should create GTP-U successfully; F1 Setup should complete (see DU MAC and CU RRC/F1AP logs).
- RU/rfsim server should start; UE should connect and then synchronize to SSB, enabling PRACH and RRC.
- If still failing, ensure `127.0.0.3` exists/aliases on loopback; otherwise, use `127.0.0.1` consistently on both CU and DU or configure host aliases accordingly.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial; exact ordering is inferred. The transport assert and `getaddrinfo` failure conclusively indicate addressing root cause.
- The JSON shows selected fields; ensure any other places referencing DU/CU IPs remain consistent after correction.
