## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. CU is in SA mode, brings up NGAP with AMF and starts F1AP. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC for TDD band n78. UE attempts to connect to the rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.

Guided by misconfigured_param: prach_ConfigurationIndex = 200. In NR (3GPP TS 38.211 §6.3.3.2), PRACH configuration index selects time/frequency occasions for PRACH. Certain indices are invalid for given numerologies or cause PRACH symbols to extend beyond the slot duration. OAI validates that the PRACH occasions fit within 14 OFDM symbols; otherwise it aborts.

Network_config highlights relevant to PRACH/SCS:
- du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon[0]: band n78, SCS 30 kHz (subcarrierSpacing: 1), DL/UL PRB 106, ABSFREQSSB ~3.6192 GHz.
- prach_ConfigurationIndex is set to 200 (misconfigured); typical working values in OAI examples for this setup are around 98.
- UE RF aligns to 3619200000 Hz with numerology 1 (30 kHz), consistent with DU.

Expected flow: CU up (NGAP/F1AP) → DU up (MAC/RRC configured, rfsim server active) → UE connects to rfsim, decodes SIB, performs PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session. Here, DU aborts during ServingCellConfigCommon fix-up due to an invalid PRACH index that schedules PRACH outside the slot.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode; NGSetupRequest/Response successful; CU starts F1AP and sockets.
- CU waits for DU; no further DU association progress due to DU aborting.

Cross-reference: CU networking is fine and unaffected by PRACH configuration.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Normal radio init for n78 until PRACH validation:
  - Assertion (prach_info.start_symbol + prach_info.N_t_slot * prach_info.N_dur < 14) failed!
  - In fix_scc() .../gnb_config.c:529
  - Message: PRACH with configuration index 200 goes to the last symbol of the slot; pick another index. See Tables 6.3.3.2-2..-4 in 38.211
  - Exits immediately thereafter.
- Interpretation: OAI computes PRACH timing from the index for the configured numerology/pattern. Index 200 results in PRACH occupying or extending beyond the last symbol, violating the 14-symbol slot boundary, hence the assert and exit.

Link to network_config: The sole offending field is `prach_ConfigurationIndex: 200`. Other parameters (TDD pattern, SCS, PRBs) are coherent.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with matching RF and numerology.
- It would attempt to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, but with DU aborted before starting/keeping rfsim server, UE will fail to connect (errno 111) and cannot proceed to PRACH.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU reads SCC → PRACH index 200 produces out-of-slot PRACH timing → assertion in fix_scc() → DU exit → UE cannot connect; CU sees no DU association.
- Root cause: Invalid PRACH configuration index for the given deployment (SCS 30 kHz, n78). The index must select PRACH occasions that fit within 14 symbols.
- Standards/context: 3GPP TS 38.211 defines allowed PRACH indices and their time-domain mapping for given numerology and formats. OAI enforces this with a slot-boundary check.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix DU PRACH configuration index:
  - Set `prach_ConfigurationIndex` to a valid value for n78 and SCS 30 kHz, e.g., 98 (commonly used in OAI examples for similar configs).
  - Keep `msg1_SubcarrierSpacing` and other PRACH fields coherent (already 1 for 30 kHz).
- Validate after change:
  - DU should pass `fix_scc()` without assertion, complete MAC/RRC config, and start the rfsim server on 4043.
  - UE should connect, decode SIB, perform PRACH successfully, and proceed to RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - If using different PRACH formats or TDD patterns, consult 38.211 Tables 6.3.3.2-2..-4 and OAI docs to pick a compatible index.

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON with comments indicating changes):

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "servingCellConfigCommon": [
          {
            "prach_ConfigurationIndex": 98, // FIX: was 200; 98 fits within slot for mu=1
            "msg1_SubcarrierSpacing": 1 // keep 30 kHz
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "cu_conf": {
    // No change required for this issue
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No change required for this issue
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Change `prach_ConfigurationIndex` to 98 (or another valid index per 38.211 and OAI guidance), restart DU, confirm no assert in fix_scc(), and that rfsim listens on 4043.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect succeeds, SIB decode, PRACH completes (Msg1/Msg2), and RRC connection proceeds.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs do not enumerate the full PRACH timing map; the assert location and explicit message, combined with the misconfigured_param, pinpoint the cause.
- The exact valid indices depend on PRACH format, frequency range, and numerology; 98 is a known-good example for mu=1 in OAI demos. Adjust as needed per 38.211 tables if using different formats/patterns.
