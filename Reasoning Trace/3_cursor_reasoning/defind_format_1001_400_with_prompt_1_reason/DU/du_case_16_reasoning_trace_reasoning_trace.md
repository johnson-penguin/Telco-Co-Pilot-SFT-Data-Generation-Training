## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

Scenario: OAI 5G NR Standalone with RF simulator. CU and DU start in SA mode; CU establishes NGAP with AMF, then F1 towards DU. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC, encodes SIB1/ServingCellConfigCommon, and should open the RFsim server. UE runs in RFsim client mode and attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Expected flow: CU init → NGAP setup with AMF → F1AP between CU/DU → DU brings up RFsim server and RRC config (SIB1) → UE connects to RFsim server → PRACH/RA → RRC connection → PDU session.

Network config highlights (from network_config):
- CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43` (CU logs show AMF at 192.168.8.43) while `amf_ip_address.ipv4=192.168.70.132` exists but appears unused by this run.
- DU `servingCellConfigCommon[0]` shows NR SA TDD n78 with 106 PRBs, SCS 30 kHz, PRACH idx 98, ZCZC 13. Critically, it sets `pucchGroupHopping=3`.
- UE config includes IMSI/keys only; RFsim defaults used by binary; UE attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 per logs.

Guiding clue (misconfigured_param): `pucchGroupHopping=3`.
3GPP TS 38.331 defines pucch-GroupHopping as ENUMERATED { neither(0), enable(1), disable(2) }. Value 3 is invalid. In OAI, this is mapped into `NR_PUCCH_ConfigCommon.pucch_GroupHopping` and encoded in SIB/ServingCellConfigCommon; invalid value triggers ASN.1 encode error during clone/encoding.

Initial mismatch signals:
- DU fails in RRC config encoding with assertion at `clone_pucch_configcommon()`; corresponds to invalid PUCCH config.
- UE cannot connect to RFsim server because DU never completes bring-up to open the server socket.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode/threads/services: SA mode; NGAP and GTPU initialized; RRC task running.
- AMF setup succeeds: NGSetupRequest → NGSetupResponse; CU is registered with AMF.
- F1AP: CU starts F1AP and prepares SCTP to 127.0.0.5.

Observations:
- CU proceeds normally and waits for DU over F1. No crash indicated.
- AMF IP usage is consistent with `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43` seen in logs. The `amf_ip_address.ipv4=192.168.70.132` in the JSON is likely an unused field in this configuration path.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- Mode/PHY/MAC init: SA mode; PHY and MAC initialized; TDD config for 5 ms period, band n78 at 3619.2 MHz DL/UL, 106 PRBs.
- RRC reading ServingCellConfigCommon shows expected parameters (PhysCellId 0, SSB frequency/PointA/BW, PRACH, timers, etc.).
- Failure point:
  - Assertion failure: `enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)`
  - In `clone_pucch_configcommon()` openair2/RRC/NR/nr_rrc_config.c:183
  - "could not clone NR_PUCCH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding"
  - Exits softmodem.

Link to config:
- `servingCellConfigCommon[0].pucchGroupHopping` is set to 3 in DU config. OAI maps this to the 38.331 enum; 3 is out of range, causing ASN.1 encoding to fail during SIB/ServingCellConfigCommon build, exactly matching the assertion in `clone_pucch_configcommon()`.

Side effects:
- DU exits before bringing up the RFsim server and before F1AP association to CU.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- RFsim client repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and gets ECONNREFUSED (errno 111).
- This is a consequence of the DU crash: the RFsim server socket is never opened by DU, so UE cannot connect.

Config linkage:
- UE’s RFsim address defaults to localhost in binary; DU’s `rfsimulator.serveraddr` shows "server" (OAI may interpret it as server mode), but because DU exits early, no listener exists regardless of address correctness.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- CU is healthy and waiting for F1; NGAP with AMF established → not the source of failure.
- DU aborts during RRC configuration encoding due to invalid `pucchGroupHopping` value.
- UE’s repeated RFsim connection failures are secondary to the DU not running.

Root cause: Misconfigured `pucchGroupHopping=3` in DU `servingCellConfigCommon`. Per 3GPP TS 38.331, valid values are 0:neither, 1:enable, 2:disable. Value 3 is invalid and triggers ASN.1 encode assertion in OAI (`clone_pucch_configcommon`).

External validation note: Public references and OAI code align with 38.331 enum; value 3 is not defined and will fail encoding.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fix:
- Set `pucchGroupHopping` to a valid enum:
  - 0 → neither (no group hopping)
  - 1 → enable (sequence/group hopping per config)
  - 2 → disable (disable hopping but enable sequence hopping if configured)

Suggested conservative change: use `neither` (0) to avoid hopping-related complexities unless a specific hopping behavior is desired.

Corrected snippets (within provided `network_config` structure):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "servingCellConfigCommon": [
            {
              "pucchGroupHopping": 0
              // changed from 3 → 0 (neither). Valid values: 0,1,2 per 38.331
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        // Optional: ensure AMF IP alignment if needed by your deployment path
        // "amf_ip_address": { "ipv4": "192.168.8.43" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Apply the DU config change and restart DU first; verify it stays up past RRC/SIB encoding and opens RFsim server.
- Start UE; confirm connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds and PRACH/RA proceeds.
- Verify F1AP establishment CU↔DU and NG procedures (UE registration, PDU session) proceed.

Further checks:
- Validate other enums/fields in `servingCellConfigCommon` (e.g., PRACH indices vs SCS, timers) against 38.211/38.331.
- Ensure CU/DU F1 addresses/ports match (`127.0.0.5` CU ⇄ `127.0.0.3` DU) as already indicated.

---

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps, so precise timing correlation is approximate.
- UE config omits explicit RFsim client parameters; analysis assumes defaults from binary.
- While AMF address duplication exists in CU config, CU logs indicate correct address selection; not causal here.

Conclusion: The DU crash is deterministically caused by `pucchGroupHopping=3`. Correcting it to a valid value (e.g., 0) resolves the ASN.1 encoding failure, allowing DU bring-up, RFsim server availability, UE connection, and end-to-end procedures to proceed.
