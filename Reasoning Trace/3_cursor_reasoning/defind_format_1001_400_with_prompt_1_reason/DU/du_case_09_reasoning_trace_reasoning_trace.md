## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. CU is in SA mode, brings up NGAP with AMF and starts F1AP. DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC for TDD band n78. UE attempts to connect to the rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.

Guided by misconfigured_param: pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP = 0. In OAI, PDSCH antenna ports are configured via N1, N2, and XP (cross-polarization ports). Setting XP to 0 can collapse the computed total TX antenna ports used by MAC/RLC configuration, causing consistency checks to fail during DU initialization.

Network_config highlights relevant to PDSCH/MIMO:
- du_conf.gNBs[0].pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP = 0 (misconfigured)
- du_conf.gNBs[0].pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1 = 2, pusch_AntennaPorts = 4, maxMIMO_layers = 1
- du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon[0]: n78, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106; matches logs. UE RF aligns to 3619200000 Hz.
- cu_conf network interfaces/IDs are consistent; not related to the failure.

Expected flow: CU up (NGAP/F1AP) → DU up (MAC/RRC configured, rfsim server active) → UE connects to rfsim, decodes SIB, performs RA → RRC attach and PDU session. Here, DU aborts during MAC/RLC config, so rfsim server never accepts UE connections.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGSetupRequest/Response successful; CU starts F1AP and creates sockets on 127.0.0.5.
- CU-UP acceptance and GTP-U creation occur; no fatal errors.
- No subsequent F1AP DU association events appear—consistent with DU failing before F1 setup completes.

Cross-reference with cu_conf: Interface IPs and ports match `NETWORK_INTERFACES`. No issues linked to antenna config on CU side.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes NR PHY/MAC/RRC with band 78, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106. Printed antenna config shows: `pdsch_AntennaPorts N1 2 N2 1 XP 0 pusch_AntennaPorts 4`.
- Hard failure shortly after:
  - Assertion (config.maxMIMO_layers != 0 && config.maxMIMO_layers <= tot_ant) failed!
  - In RCconfig_nr_macrlc() ../../../openair2/GNB_APP/gnb_config.c:1538
  - Invalid maxMIMO_layers 1
  - Exiting execution
- Interpretation: OAI computes `tot_ant` for downlink based on PDSCH antenna port settings (N1/N2/XP and/or RU nb_tx). With XP=0, the derived `tot_ant` for PDSCH becomes 0 or otherwise inconsistent, so the check `maxMIMO_layers <= tot_ant` fails even though `maxMIMO_layers` is 1. This matches the guided misconfiguration and the printed `XP 0`.

Link to network_config: du_conf explicitly sets `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP: 0` and `maxMIMO_layers: 1`, reproducing the failure. Other radio parameters (PRACH, TDD) are valid and not implicated by the assertion.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with RF settings matching DU (3619200000 Hz, SCS 30 kHz) and starts threads.
- It repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and gets errno 111 (connection refused).
- Correlation: DU aborts before rfsimulator server is listening, so UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → DU reads config, logs `XP 0`, then asserts on MIMO layer vs total antenna ports → process exits → UE cannot connect to rfsim → CU sees no DU association.
- Root cause: `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=0` leads to an invalid total PDSCH antenna port computation (`tot_ant`), violating `maxMIMO_layers <= tot_ant` in `RCconfig_nr_macrlc`. With XP≥1 (typically 2 for cross-polarization), `tot_ant` is sufficient for `maxMIMO_layers=1` and the assertion does not trigger.
- Standards/context: While 3GPP does not prescribe these vendor-specific knobs (N1/N2/XP), OAI expects a coherent PDSCH antenna port configuration that yields at least one usable DL layer when `maxMIMO_layers>=1`.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix the DU antenna port config:
  - Set `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP` to a valid non-zero value, typically 2 for cross-polarization. Ensure `maxMIMO_layers <= (derived tot_ant)`; with XP=2 and N1=2 (and N2=1 implicit from logs), `maxMIMO_layers=1` is safe.
- Validate after change:
  - DU should pass `RCconfig_nr_macrlc` without assertion and start the rfsim server on 4043.
  - UE should connect, decode SIB, and proceed to RA/RRC connection.
- Optional checks:
  - Confirm `RUs[0].nb_tx` remains consistent with DL antenna ports and precoding configuration.
  - Keep `maxMIMO_layers` at 1 unless more ports/layers are configured end-to-end.

  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update the DU config to set `pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP = 2`.
- Restart DU; verify the assertion is gone and rfsim listens on 4043.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect succeeds, SIB decode, RA, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs do not show the computed `tot_ant` value; the inference is based on OAI’s assertion condition and the visible `XP 0` setting.
- Timestamps are absent; sequencing is inferred from log ordering and OAI startup behavior.
- Vendor-specific semantics of N1/N2/XP are based on OAI configuration expectations rather than a 3GPP mandate.
