## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI NR SA using rfsimulator. DU logs show SA mode and F1AP toward CU over localhost (`DU 127.0.0.3 ↔ CU 127.0.0.5`). UE tries to connect as rfsim client to `127.0.0.1:4043`. Expected flow: CU parses config → initializes NGAP/GTU/F1-C → DU starts, awaits F1 Setup → upon F1 Setup Response, DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim → SSB/PRACH/RACH complete → RRC attach/PDU session. We watch for config parsing failures and inter-component connection issues.

From the provided JSON, the misconfigured parameter is: `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=abc.def.ghi.jkl` (invalid IPv4). CU logs indeed show libconfig parse failure and aborted init. The DU shows repeated SCTP connection refused to the CU. The UE shows repeated connection refused to rfsim server at 4043, consistent with DU not activating radio because F1 setup never completes.

Key network_config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES: `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF = "192.168.8.43"` (valid), but the actual `.conf` file used in the run (see CU log path) contains an invalid `amf_ip_address.ipv4` string token, causing parse failure.
- du_conf: F1 endpoints `local_n_address=127.0.0.3`, `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5` match DU logs; radio config looks sane; rfsimulator set to `server` on port 4043.
- ue_conf: IMSI and keys typical test values; UE attempts 3619.2 MHz band/numerology consistent with DU.

Initial mismatch: CU config parsing collapses due to invalid AMF IPv4 token, preventing CU start → F1 failure → DU does not activate radio → UE cannot connect to rfsim server.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Early messages:
  - `[LIBCONFIG] ... line 91: syntax error` and `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded` → parsing error at the configuration file level.
  - `LOG init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed` and `Getting configuration failed` → CU initialization stops before network interfaces/NGAP/F1 are configured.
- Command line shows SA+rfsim with the problematic `.conf`: CU never reaches NGAP or F1 setup stages.
- Cross-reference: A malformed `amf_ip_address.ipv4` like `abc.def.ghi.jkl` is not a valid IPv4 literal and is unquoted/invalid for libconfig grammar, producing exactly a syntax error.

Conclusion: CU is down due to config parse failure caused by invalid AMF IP value.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly, prints serving cell config and TDD mapping; no PRACH/PHY asserts.
- F1AP connection attempts: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` followed by repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and retry loop.
- `GNB_APP waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` indicates that RU activation (and hence rfsimulator server readiness) is gated on a successful F1 setup.

Conclusion: DU is healthy but blocked by CU absence; cannot complete F1 setup, so it does not activate radio.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY and attempts to connect as an rfsimulator client to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly; each attempt fails with `errno(111)` (connection refused), indicating no listener on that port.
- This is consistent with DU not activating radio/rfsimulator server due to missing F1 Setup Response from CU.

Conclusion: UE failure is a downstream effect of DU not serving rfsim, which itself is blocked by CU failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Misconfigured parameter: invalid CU `amf_ip_address.ipv4` token causes libconfig parse error → CU aborts.
- Without CU, F1-C from DU to CU at `127.0.0.5` is refused → DU cannot get F1 Setup Response → DU keeps radio deactivated.
- With radio deactivated, rfsimulator server at 4043 is not accepting connections → UE connection attempts to `127.0.0.1:4043` are refused.

Therefore, the primary root cause is the invalid AMF IPv4 literal in CU configuration. All other observed failures are cascading symptoms.

Notes on spec/implementation:
- OAI gNB (CU) requires valid NGAP AMF address; in classic libconfig syntax it is set under `amf_ip_address { ipv4 = "<a.b.c.d>"; }` or via `NETWORK_INTERFACES` in newer JSON-like configs. Invalid tokens cause libconfig parse errors before runtime validation.
- DU behavior is expected: F1 setup gating radio activation is a common OAI pattern.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix CU config: set a valid IPv4 for AMF and ensure proper libconfig quoting/format. If AMF runs locally, use `127.0.0.1` or a reachable IPv4.
- After fixing CU, verify:
  - CU starts, NGAP initializes (even if AMF is absent, at least CU should run and F1 should come up).
  - DU completes F1 Setup and logs `F1AP_SETUP_RESPONSE` → `Activating radio`.
  - UE connects to rfsim server (4043) and proceeds to SSB/PRACH.

Corrected configuration snippets (as JSON representation of intended values):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "127.0.0.1"  // set to a valid/reachable AMF IP
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If your CU uses the classic libconfig `amf_ip_address` block, ensure it is valid and quoted, e.g.:

```json
{
  "libconfig_equivalent": {
    "amf_ip_address": {
      "ipv4": "127.0.0.1",    // previously was abc.def.ghi.jkl (invalid)
      "ipv6": null,
      "active": 0
    }
  }
}
```

DU/UE do not require changes for this root cause. Optionally, confirm DU’s F1 endpoints match CU (`remote_n_address` 127.0.0.5, ports 500/501) and that rfsimulator `serverport` matches UE (4043), which they do.

Suggested debug steps after fix:
- Start CU and confirm no libconfig errors.
- Start DU; expect F1AP association success and log of radio activation.
- Start UE; expect successful TCP connect to 4043, SSB sync, RA, and RRC connection establishment.

## 7. Limitations
- CU logs are truncated to the parse failure; we don’t see later NGAP/F1 stages by design—because CU never starts.
- The provided `cu_conf` JSON shows a valid AMF IP, but the live `.conf` referenced by CU logs differs and contains the invalid token—this analysis assumes the live `.conf` is authoritative for the run.
- No AMF logs are provided; the fix assumes AMF is reachable at the chosen IPv4.

Bottom line: Correct the CU’s AMF IP to a valid IPv4 literal and restart. This unblocks F1 setup, DU radio activation (rfsim server), and UE connectivity.
