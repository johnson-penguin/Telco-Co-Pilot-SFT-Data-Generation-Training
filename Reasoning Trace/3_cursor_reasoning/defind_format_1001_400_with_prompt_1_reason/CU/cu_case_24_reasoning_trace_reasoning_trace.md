## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- System uses OAI NR SA with rfsimulator (command line shows "--rfsim --sa").
- Components and expected flow:
  1) CU loads config, initializes NGAP/GTU, starts F1-C server.
  2) DU initializes PHY/MAC, connects F1-C to CU, then activates radio and rfsim server.
  3) UE connects to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043, performs cell search → SIB1 → PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter: `security.drb_integrity=None` (in CU config). OAI expects `drb_integrity` to be either "yes" or "no" (and integrity algorithms defined). Setting `None` causes config parsing failure.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- CU `gNBs.local_s_address`: 127.0.0.5; DU targets this as `remote_n_address` — coherent.
- CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` for NGAP/NGU: 192.168.8.43 (consistent with typical lab setup).
- CU `security`:
  - `ciphering_algorithms`: [nea3, nea2, nea1, nea0]
  - `integrity_algorithms`: [nia2, nia0]
  - `drb_ciphering`: "yes"
  - `drb_integrity`: MISSING in provided JSON; misconfigured input says it was set to `None` in the failing case.
- DU: Normal SA TDD config, PRACH cfg index 98, addresses 127.0.0.3 (local) and 127.0.0.5 (CU).
- UE: Default SIM, rfsim client behavior seen in logs (repeated connect attempts).

Initial mismatch: CU config parse fails at startup due to invalid value for `security.drb_integrity` ("None"), preventing CU from launching and thus preventing DU F1 connection and UE progress.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Immediate parser error:
  - "[LIBCONFIG] ... line 77: syntax error"
  - "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded" → config not initialized
  - "LOG init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed" → CU does not start any tasks
  - "function config_libconfig_init returned -1" → fatal failure
- No NGAP/F1AP threads created; CU exits before network initialization.

Cross-reference to network_config: The only targeted misconfiguration is `security.drb_integrity=None`. OAI libconfig expects boolean-like string ("yes"/"no") for this key; using `None` either as bare token or quoted can still be invalid (bare token unrecognized; quoted "None" fails validation in later stages). The log confirms a parser-level syntax error, consistent with an invalid token.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC and enters F1 setup:
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" → addressing is correct.
  - Repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and F1AP retries.
  - "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" → DU does not activate radio nor rfsim server.
- Cause: CU never started F1-C listener due to config parse failure; thus SCTP connect is refused.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043 and gets errno(111) connection refused.
- Cause: DU did not activate radio or rfsim server because F1 Setup never completed (blocked by CU failure).

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU fails at configuration parsing (syntax error) → CU process aborts.
  - DU can’t reach F1-C server (ECONNREFUSED), remains in retry loop, and does not activate radio/rfsim server.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server (ECONNREFUSED) and loops.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): `security.drb_integrity=None` is invalid for OAI libconfig; expected values are "yes" or "no" (and integrity algorithms list governs which NIA options are available). The invalid token produces a parse error at or near line 77.
- This is a configuration syntactic/semantic error rather than a radio parameter mismatch; no 3GPP spec lookup is required.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix CU `security` block to valid values:
  - Set `drb_integrity` to "no" if you intend to disable DRB integrity, or "yes" to enable (with appropriate `integrity_algorithms` list, e.g., nia2 as preferred).
  - Ensure the line uses valid libconfig syntax and value domain.

Corrected snippets within `network_config` (JSON-style representation; ensure your actual `.conf` syntax matches OAI format):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"  // FIX: replace invalid None with "yes" or "no"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      // No changes needed for DU security for this issue
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No changes needed for UE for this issue
    }
  }
}
```

Operational validation after fix:
- Start CU: verify no libconfig errors; F1AP server should start.
- Start DU: F1 Setup should succeed; DU activates radio and starts rfsim server on 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Start UE: rfsim client should connect; observe SSB/SIB1, PRACH, RRC attach, PDU session setup.

If further issues appear:
- Increase CU/DU `f1ap_log_level` to `debug` and CU `log_config.global_log_level` to see negotiation.
- Ensure `integrity_algorithms` contains at least one supported algorithm on both gNB and UE (e.g., NIA2).
- If enabling `drb_integrity: "yes"`, verify AMF/UPF and UE stack support the selected integrity.

## 7. Limitations

- CU logs are truncated to the parser failure; no timestamps included.
- Provided `cu_conf` JSON omits the failing exact line; we infer from misconfigured_param and error location that `drb_integrity=None` caused the syntax error.
- The JSON shown is a normalized extraction; ensure the actual `.conf` (libconfig) uses correct syntax and values.
