## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
Based on the logs, this is an OAI 5G NR Standalone setup using `--rfsim` with F1 split (CU/DU) and a UE simulator. Expected bring-up: process config → CU initializes and connects to AMF (NGAP) → DU starts and establishes F1-C to CU → DU activates radio/RFSIM server → UE connects to RFSIM server → SSB/PRACH/RRC → registration/PDU session.

Key inputs:
- misconfigured_param: `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=` (empty IPv4 for AMF in CU `.conf`).
- network_config.gnb/ue summary (JSON provided):
  - CU (`cu_conf.gNBs`): F1 local `127.0.0.5`, DU peer `127.0.0.3`; NGU `192.168.8.43`. `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` set to `192.168.8.43` (OK in JSON form).
  - DU (`du_conf`): RFSIM server mode (`rfsimulator.serveraddr: "server"`, port `4043`); F1 DU `127.0.0.3` → CU `127.0.0.5`; TDD n78, SSB at 3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, PRACH index 98; consistent PHY/MAC parameters.
  - UE: IMSI/DNN only; UE logs indicate RFSIM client to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial mismatch vs logs and misconfigured_param:
- CU log shows `libconfig` syntax error and config load failure at CU `.conf` line 91. This aligns with an empty `amf_ip_address.ipv4` field causing parsing failure. Consequently CU aborts, preventing DU’s F1-C association and DU radio activation, which in turn blocks the UE’s RFSIM connection.

Conclusion to investigate: Primary failure is at CU configuration parse due to missing AMF IPv4; downstream symptoms at DU/UE follow from CU not running.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- `[LIBCONFIG] ... syntax error` then `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded` → CU configuration invalid; sections skipped; `init aborted` → CU exits early.
- Command line confirms CU invoked with `--rfsim --sa -O .../cu_case_118.conf`.
- No NGAP/AMF or F1AP activity appears; the process never reaches runtime initialization.

Cross-reference configuration:
- The JSON `cu_conf` shows proper NG interface fields, but the actual `.conf` (libconfig format) referenced by the CU run had `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=` empty, triggering parser error. In OAI libconfig syntax, empty string or missing quotes at a required string field yields a syntax error.

Impact:
- Without a valid AMF IPv4 in CU `.conf`, CU aborts before binding NGAP/SCTP and before accepting F1 from DU.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly for n78 µ1, 106 PRBs; prints TDD pattern, frequencies, SIB1 parameters, and F1AP DU endpoint lines.
- F1AP: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` followed by repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and retry loops.
- DU prints `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` and remains in a pre-activation state.

Link to CU failure:
- Connection refused indicates CU’s F1-C server is not listening (because CU aborted on config parse error). Hence DU cannot progress to radio activation or RFSIM server start.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY, sets DL/UL freq to 3619.2 MHz (matches DU), and acts as RFSIM client.
- Repeated `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)` indicates no RFSIM server is listening.

Link to DU state:
- DU is configured as RFSIM server (`serveraddr: "server"`). However, DU with F1 split typically activates radio and RFSIM after successful F1 Setup. Since F1 never completes, DU does not start (or does not fully activate) the RFSIM endpoint, so the UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Root cause guided by misconfigured_param: `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=` (empty) in the CU `.conf` causes `libconfig` syntax error → CU aborts.
- Downstream effects:
  - DU cannot connect F1-C to CU (`Connection refused` at 127.0.0.5), remains waiting for F1 Setup Response, and does not activate radio/RFSIM.
  - UE, running as RFSIM client, repeatedly fails to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` because no server is up.

No additional PHY/MAC misconfiguration is implicated by logs; PRACH and TDD parameters look consistent. The failure chain is purely control-plane bring-up blocked at CU configuration parse.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix (CU `.conf` in libconfig format):
- Provide a valid IPv4 for AMF in `amf_ip_address` (or `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4` depending on schema) and ensure proper quoting/structure. Align with your 5GC AMF IP (could be `127.0.0.1` for local core, or your LAN IP). Also ensure the section braces and semicolons are correct.

Secondary checks:
- Confirm CU F1-C bind is `127.0.0.5` matching DU’s F1-C destination `127.0.0.5`.
- Ensure firewall allows SCTP on F1-C port and UDP/2152 for GTP-U if needed.
- After CU fix, verify DU logs show F1 Setup complete and radio activation, then UE should connect to RFSIM and proceed with SSB/PRACH and RRC.

Corrected configuration snippets (expressed in your provided JSON-style for clarity):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "local_s_if_name": "lo",
        "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
        "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3",
        "SCTP": { "SCTP_INSTREAMS": 2, "SCTP_OUTSTREAMS": 2 },
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Comment: Ensure the actual libconfig `.conf` has a valid AMF IPv4 string (e.g., `"192.168.8.43"`) and not empty. For classic libconfig, this typically looks like:

```c
amf_ip_address = (
  { ipv4 = "192.168.8.43"; port = 38412; active = "yes"; }
);
```

DU and UE JSON remain valid; no change required. For completeness, confirm RFSIM server/client alignment:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": { "serveraddr": "server", "serverport": 4043 }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": { "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", "serverport": 4043 }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational validation steps:
- Start CU (watch for NGAP AMF association success).
- Start DU, confirm F1 Setup completes and radio activates.
- Start UE, confirm RFSIM TCP connects and UE detects SSB, performs PRACH, then RRC attach and registration.

## 7. Limitations
- CU log excerpt is short; exact `.conf` content (line 91) not shown, but the empty `amf_ip_address.ipv4` matches the parser error and explains all downstream symptoms.
- AMF IP address in JSON may differ from the actual 5GC deployment; ensure it matches your core’s reachable IP.
- Timing dependencies (DU radio activation gated by F1 Setup) are based on OAI’s typical control flow; specific versions may vary slightly.
