## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

The scenario is OAI NR SA with rfsimulator: CU and DU run in split F1 mode, and UE runs as an rfsim client. Expected bring-up: CU initializes NGAP/SCTP toward AMF, F1-C listens for DU, DU connects to F1-C, radio activates, UE connects to rfsim server, RACH/RRC attach proceeds.

Key config from network_config:
- CU `gNBs.tr_s_preference=f1`, `local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address=127.0.0.3`. NG-U GTP-U at `192.168.8.43:2152`.
- CU `amf_ip_address.ipv4=192.168.70.132` but `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=abc.def.ghi.jkl` (misconfigured_param). This field must be a valid IPv4 or resolvable hostname for NGAP/SCTP bind/connect.
- DU targets F1-C CU at `127.0.0.5`, binds GTP-U `127.0.0.3`.
- UE is configured for SA at 3.6192 GHz, connects to rfsim server `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial suspicion from misconfigured_param: invalid NG-AMF IP string causes CU NGAP SCTP association failure early, preventing CU from staying up; DU then cannot establish F1; UE cannot connect to rfsim server since DU never activates radio.

Additional relevant radio params (DU): TDD SCS 30 kHz, N_RB=106, PCI=0, SSB ARFCN=641280 (3619.2 MHz), PRACH index 98, typical for band n78. No radio-side mismatch indicated in logs.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Observations:
- CU runs SA mode, initializes NGAP, F1AP, RRC, GTP-U. Logs: "Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: abc.def.ghi.jkl".
- Immediately after, assertion in `sctp_handle_new_association_req` with `getaddrinfo(abc.def.ghi.jkl) failed: Name or service not known`, then process exits.
- Earlier it created/initialized GTP-U on `192.168.8.43:2152`; also shows `F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5` before the assert exit line.

Interpretation:
- CU attempts to resolve or bind/connect toward AMF using `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` and fails DNS/format validation (getaddrinfo). OAI asserts and exits CU process.
- Consequently, CU never reaches a stable NGAP association nor a stable F1-C listener state for DU.

Config linkage:
- network_config shows `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=abc.def.ghi.jkl` (invalid). This directly matches the failing literal in logs.
- `amf_ip_address.ipv4=192.168.70.132` (valid) is inconsistent with the NETWORK_INTERFACES override used by the code path that called getaddrinfo.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Observations:
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC and F1AP. It tries to connect: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by F1AP retry messages. DU is waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
- No PHY/RACH/assert errors; the failure mode is purely control-plane connectivity to CU.

Interpretation:
- Connection refused implies the CU-side SCTP endpoint is not listening (CU exited due to earlier assert). Thus DU cannot proceed to activate the cell.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Observations:
- UE initializes for SA at 3619.2 MHz, starts rfsimulator client.
- Repeated attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` fail with errno(111) (connection refused).

Interpretation:
- In OAI rfsim, the gNB/DU side hosts the rfsim server. Because DU waits for F1 setup and radio activation (blocked on CU), it likely never starts or keeps the rfsim server in an accepting state, hence UE connection refused.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- Misconfigured CU `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` → getaddrinfo failure → CU asserts and exits.
- DU attempts F1-C to CU `127.0.0.5` → connection refused because CU is down.
- UE attempts to connect to rfsim server `127.0.0.1:4043` → connection refused because DU cannot activate radio without F1 setup.

Root cause:
- The single misconfigured parameter `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=abc.def.ghi.jkl` is invalid. OAI uses this to set up NGAP/SCTP networking and calls `getaddrinfo` on it; invalid literal/hostname causes name resolution failure and an assert exit.

Why this parameter matters:
- OAI requires valid local/remote IP configuration for NGAP. `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` must be a valid IPv4 address string (e.g., the AMF’s IPv4) or properly resolvable hostname. Using a non-IP literal with dots that is not a hostname results in `EAI_NONAME` from `getaddrinfo`, triggering an assert in the NGAP/SCTP setup code.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Primary fix:
- Replace `abc.def.ghi.jkl` with the actual AMF IPv4 address already present in `amf_ip_address.ipv4`, or ensure consistency so both fields point to the same valid address. Example: `192.168.70.132`.

Post-fix validation steps:
- Start CU: confirm no `getaddrinfo` errors; NGAP connects to AMF.
- Start DU: verify F1 Setup completes; radio activates.
- Start UE: confirm rfsim connects; observe PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session establishment.
- Optional: verify SCTP/NGAP connectivity with `ss -tpun | grep sctp` and packet captures; ensure routing/firewall permits SCTP to AMF.

Corrected config snippets (JSON-style with comments):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "amf_ip_address": { "ipv4": "192.168.70.132" },
      "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
        // FIX: Use a valid IPv4 reachable AMF address (was "abc.def.ghi.jkl")
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.70.132",
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
        "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
      }
    }
  },
  "du_conf": {
    // No change required for this issue; DU will succeed once CU is up
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // No change required; UE was blocked by DU not serving rfsim
  }
}
```

Further analysis if issues persist after the fix:
- Confirm CU can reach AMF IP (routing/NAT/firewall). If AMF is on another host, ensure proper interface binding.
- Ensure `local_s_address`/`remote_s_address` for F1 are consistent (127.0.0.5/127.0.0.3) across CU/DU.
- If NGAP still fails, increase `ngap_log_level` to `debug` and check SCTP association states.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated without timestamps; ordering inferred from content. DU radio activation step is not explicitly shown; inference based on repeated F1 SCTP failures.
- JSON shows only a subset of full gNB/UE configs; other network factors (routes/firewall) are assumed standard. The fix addresses the explicit, reproduced failure linked to `getaddrinfo`.
