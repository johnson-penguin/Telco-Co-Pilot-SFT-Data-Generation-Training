## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
OAI NR SA with rfsimulator. DU and CU communicate via F1-C over localhost (DU 127.0.0.3 ↔ CU 127.0.0.5). UE is an rfsim client attempting TCP to 127.0.0.1:4043. Expected flow: CU parses config → NGAP/GTPU/F1-C init → DU starts, opens F1 toward CU → after F1 Setup Response, DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim → SSB/PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.

Misconfigured parameter: gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=abc.def.ghi.jkl (invalid address). This targets the CU’s NGAP AMF endpoint. We therefore expect CU-side NGAP SCTP address resolution to fail, possibly causing an assertion and early exit.

network_config parse:
- cu_conf.gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES: GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF is set to abc.def.ghi.jkl (invalid). GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU=192.168.8.43 and GTPU port 2152 look fine. A legacy field amf_ip_address.ipv4=192.168.70.132 also exists, but logs indicate the NETWORK_INTERFACES value is used.
- du_conf: F1 DU↔CU addressing (127.0.0.3 ↔ 127.0.0.5) matches logs; radio config (band 78, mu=1, N_RB=106) is coherent; rfsimulator acts as server at 4043.
- ue_conf: standard test IMSI/keys; UE RF setup in logs matches DU frequency/numerology.

Initial mismatch: CU attempts to use an invalid AMF address; name resolution fails; CU exits. DU cannot complete F1 association (connection refused), so radio is not activated; UE cannot connect to rfsim server (4043).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA, initializes tasks and prints: Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: abc.def.ghi.jkl.
- Immediately after, NGAP SCTP path fails: Assertion (status == 0) failed! … getaddrinfo(abc.def.ghi.jkl) failed: Name or service not known, and softmodem exits.
- GTPU config shows local NG-U address 192.168.8.43:2152, and F1AP CU starts, but the NG AMF address error aborts the process before normal operation.

Conclusion: CU terminates due to invalid NG-AMF address under NETWORK_INTERFACES, causing getaddrinfo failure and an assertion in SCTP association handling.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC and serving cell parameters; no PRACH/PHY assertions.
- F1AP repeatedly attempts SCTP connect to CU 127.0.0.5 and gets Connection refused, while DU remains waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.

Conclusion: DU is healthy but blocked by CU exit; without F1 setup, DU does not activate radio or rfsim server.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE repeatedly attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and receives errno(111) (connection refused), indicating no rfsim server listening.
- This is expected because DU has not activated radio/rfsim due to missing F1 setup with CU.

Conclusion: UE failures are downstream symptoms of DU not serving rfsim because CU terminated after AMF address resolution failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Misconfigured CU parameter (GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=abc.def.ghi.jkl) → getaddrinfo error → SCTP assertion → CU exit.
- DU cannot complete F1 with CU → radio not activated → rfsim server not listening.
- UE cannot connect to rfsim (4043) → repeated TCP connection refusals.

Root cause: invalid AMF address string in CU NETWORK_INTERFACES. All other issues cascade from CU termination.

Notes: OAI supports both legacy amf_ip_address and NETWORK_INTERFACES; in this run, the latter is in effect as shown by the CU log echoing the invalid token. Invalid hostnames/IPs are not sanitized and propagate to getaddrinfo.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix CU config: set a valid AMF IPv4/hostname reachable from the CU. For local testing, use 127.0.0.1 or your AMF’s real IP. Ensure legacy and new fields are consistent; ideally keep only one authoritative field.
- After fix: CU should no longer assert; DU should complete F1 Setup and activate radio; UE should connect to rfsim and proceed to SSB/PRACH and RRC.

Corrected configuration snippets (JSON representation within network_config):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "127.0.0.1",  // previously abc.def.ghi.jkl (invalid)
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        },
        "amf_ip_address": {
          "ipv4": "127.0.0.1"  // keep consistent or remove if unused in your version
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after applying the fix:
- Start CU: verify no getaddrinfo/assert and NGAP task runs.
- Start DU: expect F1 association success and Activating radio log.
- Start UE: expect successful TCP connect to 4043, synchronization, RA, RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- No AMF logs are provided; if AMF is not available, NG setup will fail later but should not crash CU after correcting the address.
- Presence of both legacy and new AMF fields can be version-dependent; ensure only one source of truth to avoid confusion.
- Logs lack timestamps; correlation is based on sequence and known OAI gating behavior.

Bottom line: Replace the invalid GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF with a valid/reachable AMF address. This prevents CU getaddrinfo assertion, enabling DU F1 setup, radio/rfsim activation, and UE connectivity.
