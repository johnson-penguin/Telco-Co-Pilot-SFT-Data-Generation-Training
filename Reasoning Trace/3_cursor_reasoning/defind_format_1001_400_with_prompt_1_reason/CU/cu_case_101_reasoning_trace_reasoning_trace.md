## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI NR SA mode using the RF Simulator (rfsim) for CU/DU/UE. This is evidenced by CU/DU logs showing SA mode and UE attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (rfsimulator). Expected flow: components load configs → CU/DU establish F1-C SCTP association → DU activates radio → UE connects to rfsim server → cell search/SSB → PRACH → RRC → NAS/AMF → PDU session. 

The provided `misconfigured_param` is `security.integrity_algorithms[1]=0` inside CU config. CU logs explicitly show: `unknown integrity algorithm "0" in section "security"`. This is a configuration-parse error at CU RRC startup which prevents CU from initializing and accepting F1 connections.

Network config summary (only parameters relevant to this case):
- CU (`cu_conf.gNBs`): F1 local IP `127.0.0.5`, DU remote `127.0.0.3`. NG interface bound to `192.168.8.43`, AMF `192.168.70.132`. Transport preference `f1` (CU/DU split).
- CU `security`:
  - `ciphering_algorithms`: ["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"]
  - `integrity_algorithms`: ["nia2","0"] ← mismatch: second item is the string "0" (invalid token)
  - `drb_integrity`: "no" (OK for DRBs; SRB integrity still required)
- DU (`du_conf`): RF/PHY/MAC look sane; TDD config present; F1 client connecting to CU at `127.0.0.5`.
- UE: USIM credentials present. RF parameters show band/numerology matching DU.

Initial mismatch call-out: The CU integrity algorithm list contains an invalid entry "0" instead of a valid 5G-NR integrity identifier such as `"nia0"` (null integrity) or other supported values (`nia1`,`nia2`,`nia3`). This explains the CU-side config parser error and consequently blocks F1 setup from DU and rfsim availability for UE.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key lines:
- CU starts in SA mode, shows build info and initial RAN context.
- Immediately: `[RRC] unknown integrity algorithm "0" in section "security" of the configuration file`.
- Config sections start to read, but there is no evidence of NGAP/F1AP readiness or AMF connection following the error.

Interpretation:
- CU fails during configuration parsing at RRC initialization due to invalid integrity algorithm token. In OAI, integrity/ciphering lists expect strings among known identifiers: `nia0/1/2/3` for integrity, `nea0/1/2/3` for ciphering. A raw `"0"` is not recognized and triggers a fatal or blocking error path in RRC/config processing. This prevents CU from starting NGAP and F1AP servers.
- Because the CU is not up to accept F1-C, any DU attempt to establish SCTP to `127.0.0.5` will fail with `Connection refused`.

Cross-reference with CU `network_config` confirms the presence of `"0"` in `security.integrity_algorithms[1]`.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Key lines:
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU and prepares TDD configuration, RF numerology, SSB. All PHY parameters appear nominal.
- F1AP at DU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` then `[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result... retrying...`.
- DU prints `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` and loops.

Interpretation:
- DU is healthy and trying to reach CU; connection is refused because CU never completed startup due to the config parse error. No PRACH/MAC runtime issues here; the block is strictly transport/control-plane towards the CU.

Link to `gnb_conf` parameters:
- F1 addresses match CU/DU configs (`remote_n_address` ↔ CU `local_s_address`). The failure is not an IP/port mismatch but a remote-side service absence caused by the CU error.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Key lines:
- UE RF initialization matches DU: `DL freq 3619200000 Hz`, `N_RB_DL 106`, TDD, numerology 1.
- UE acts as rfsim client: repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, always `errno(111)` (connection refused).

Interpretation:
- In OAI rfsim, the DU typically runs the simulator "server" side, exposing a TCP port (default 4043). Since the DU is not transitioning past F1 Setup (it holds radio activation while waiting for CU), it likely does not bring up or serve the rfsim endpoint for UE. Therefore, UE cannot connect and spins on connect failures.
- This is a secondary effect; the root cause originates at the CU.

Link to `ue_conf`:
- USIM parameters are fine. The rfsim server address usage is controlled by UE runtime options; the repeated connect failures indicate the server is not listening rather than a wrong IP in UE config.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU hits config error immediately due to `integrity_algorithms[1] = "0"` → CU fails to fully initialize RRC/F1/NGAP.
- DU keeps retrying SCTP to CU at `127.0.0.5` with `Connection refused` → cannot complete F1 Setup → holds radio activation.
- UE tries to connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` → `errno(111)` because DU is not serving rfsim while waiting for CU → UE cannot proceed to cell search/PRACH.

Guided by the misconfigured parameter:
- The error text matches exactly the incorrect token ("0"). OAI expects integrity algorithm identifiers to be among a known set, e.g., `"nia2"`, `"nia1"`, `"nia0"`, etc. The presence of a bare "0" causes a parser error in CU RRC. This is sufficient to explain all downstream symptoms.

No external spec lookup is required to confirm that `"0"` is invalid; the CU log states it explicitly. From 5G security principles: SRBs require integrity protection; while `nia0` (null integrity) exists in 3GPP, many implementations disallow it for SRBs or treat it specially. Regardless, the string must be a valid token like `"nia0"`, not `"0"`.

Root cause: CU configuration contains an invalid integrity algorithm token `"0"` in `security.integrity_algorithms`, causing CU RRC config parsing failure and preventing CU startup. This cascades into DU F1 connection failures and UE rfsim connection failures.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix (CU config): Replace the invalid token `"0"` with a valid integrity algorithm identifier. Recommended list ordering is strongest-first and only supported algorithms:
- Use: `["nia2", "nia1", "nia0"]` or `["nia2", "nia1"]` if you want to disallow null integrity.
- Ensure there are no stray numeric strings.

Proposed corrected `network_config` snippets (only changed sections shown):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "security": {
      "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
      "integrity_algorithms": [
        "nia2",
        "nia1",
        "nia0"
      ],
      "drb_ciphering": "yes",
      "drb_integrity": "no"
    }
  }
}
```

- // Changed: replaced invalid "0" with "nia1" and appended "nia0" explicitly.
- // Rationale: Ensure only valid tokens are provided; strongest-first ordering.

No changes are required to DU `f1` addresses or UE USIM. As a sanity check, verify F1 addresses:
- DU connects to CU `127.0.0.5` (matches CU `local_s_address`). Ports `500/501` are consistent.

Post-fix validation steps:
- Restart CU with the corrected config; confirm absence of the RRC integrity algorithm error.
- Observe CU starting F1-C server; DU should complete SCTP association and F1 Setup.
- Confirm DU activates radio; UE should connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043`, achieve SSB detection, PRACH, RRC setup, and progress to NAS attach.
- If any further issues arise (e.g., AMF connectivity), check CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` IPs and AMF reachability, but those are unrelated to the current root cause.

Optional hardening:
- If the deployment policy forbids null integrity on SRBs, remove `"nia0"` from the list and keep `["nia2","nia1"]`.
- Keep `Asn1_verbosity` to `none` in CU for performance; switch to `annoying` only for debugging.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and omit explicit CU fatal/exit lines; diagnosis relies on the explicit RRC error and the observed downstream connection refusals.
- UE rfsim client logs do not show retry backoff parameters, but repeated `errno(111)` is sufficient to infer server absence.
- This analysis assumes standard OAI behavior: DU holds radio activation pending F1 Setup; rfsim server readiness is tied to DU state. If a custom branch alters this sequencing, the causal chain may differ, but the CU config error remains the root blocker.
