\n## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with RF simulator. CU and DU operate in F1 split: CU exposes F1-C server; DU connects as F1-C client and only activates radio (RFsim server) after F1 Setup. UE is RFsim client connecting to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Expected sequence:
- CU initializes, configures RRC/security, starts F1-C and NGAP.
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1, attempts F1-C SCTP association to CU, completes F1 Setup, then activates radio (RFsim server).
- UE connects to DU RFsim server → performs PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- CU `security.integrity_algorithms`: ["nia2", ""] — second entry is empty (misconfigured).
- CU F1 addressing: CU `127.0.0.5:501` (control), DU `127.0.0.3:500` — aligns with DU logs.
- DU cell config: n78, 106 PRBs, µ=1, PRACH index 98, TDD pattern — consistent with logs.
- UE USIM present; RFsim target inferred from logs `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Immediate mismatch:
- CU logs show `[RRC] unknown integrity algorithm ""` which matches the misconfigured param `security.integrity_algorithms[1]=` (empty). This likely breaks CU RRC security configuration and prevents F1 server readiness.

Conclusion: An invalid integrity algorithm string in CU config is the prime suspect; DU and UE symptoms are cascading effects.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode and build info.
- CU RAN context (CU-only): `RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0, RC.nb_RU = 0` — expected.
- Critical error: `[RRC]   unknown integrity algorithm "" in section "security" of the configuration file`.
- Only config reading messages after; no evidence of NGAP up or F1-C listener coming online in the excerpt.

Implications:
- OAI expects valid integrity algs: `nia0/nia1/nia2/nia3`. An empty string fails validation. This error at CU initialization can block RRC setup and, by extension, F1/NGAP bring-up.

Cross-reference:
- `cu_conf.security.integrity_algorithms` is `["nia2", ""]`, matching the error (second entry empty).

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 successfully; TDD and frequency config match.
- DU starts F1AP, tries to connect from `127.0.0.3` to CU `127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.”

Interpretation:
- DU is healthy; failures are due to CU not accepting F1-C connections (likely no listener started because CU init did not complete after the security error).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes at 3.6192 GHz, µ=1, 106 PRBs — consistent with DU.
- UE is RFsim client attempting connections to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Repeated `errno(111)` connection refused — indicates no RFsim server listening.

Interpretation:
- The DU does not activate radio (RFsim server) until F1 Setup completes; since CU refuses F1, UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU raises integrity algorithm parse error at startup → likely prevents F1-C server from starting.
- DU attempts F1-C association → connection refused repeatedly.
- DU never activates radio → UE RFsim connection refused repeatedly.
- The misconfigured parameter explicitly indicates `security.integrity_algorithms[1]=` empty; the CU log error confirms it.

Root cause:
- Invalid CU integrity algorithm entry (empty string at index 1) breaks CU RRC security configuration and blocks CU bring-up, causing cascaded DU/UE failures.

Standards/implementation rationale:
- NR integrity algorithms are NIA0/1/2/3 (e.g., 3GPP TS 33.501). OAI expects valid strings `nia0`/`nia1`/`nia2`/`nia3`. Empty is invalid.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Correct CU integrity algorithms by removing the empty entry and using valid preferences (e.g., prefer stronger first):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        // Fixed: replaced empty entry with valid algorithms and ordered by preference
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia1", "nia0"],
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Restart sequence and checks:
  1) Start CU; verify no `[RRC] unknown integrity algorithm` error and that F1-C is listening (look for F1 server log lines).
  2) Start DU; confirm F1 Setup completes and “activating radio” appears; SCTP refusals cease.
  3) Start UE; confirm RFsim TCP connects and RACH proceeds.

- Optional:
  - If build supports `nia3`, use `["nia3", "nia2", "nia1", "nia0"]`.
  - Validate CU/DU F1 ports/IPs with local firewall/sockets if issues persist (but networking is already consistent per logs and config).

- No DU PRACH/TDD or UE USIM changes are needed for this specific fault.

Minimal corrected structure snippet (others unchanged):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia1", "nia0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {},
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
}
```

## 7. Limitations
- CU logs are truncated post-config, so F1 server non-readiness is inferred via DU’s SCTP refusals and the CU error.
- UE RFsim target comes from logs; explicit UE RFsim config fields are not shown.
- NGAP/AMF initialization is not covered here but is orthogonal to the identified root cause.
