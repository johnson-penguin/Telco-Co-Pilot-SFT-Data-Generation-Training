## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Scenario**: OAI 5G NR in SA mode with rfsim. DU starts successfully and waits for F1 setup with CU; UE runs as rfsim client and repeatedly fails to connect because the DU hasn’t activated radio/rfsim server yet. CU fails very early at configuration parsing.
- **Expected flow**: CU parses config → F1-C SCTP between CU and DU → DU activates radio/rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server → PRACH/RRC attach → NGAP to AMF.
- **Guiding clue (misconfigured_param)**: "gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=999.999.999.999". This is an invalid IPv4 literal and is known to break config parsing and/or NGAP resolution, depending on where it is read.
- **Immediate observation from logs**:
  - CU: libconfig syntax error; configuration module not initialized; init aborted. Therefore CU never starts F1 (F1-C not listening on 127.0.0.5), and never reaches NGAP.
  - DU: Repeated F1 SCTP connect to 127.0.0.5 is refused; DU explicitly logs "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" → rfsim server not brought up for UE.
  - UE: Repeated connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 fails with errno 111 (connection refused).
- **Parsed network_config highlights**:
  - `cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address=127.0.0.3` (F1-C topology CU⇄DU). NGU/N3 and NGAP local addresses are 192.168.8.43 (for CU).
  - `du_conf.MACRLCs.local_n_address=127.0.0.3`, `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5` (matches F1 peer).
  - `du_conf.rfsimulator.serverport=4043`, UE tries `127.0.0.1:4043` (consistent for local bench).
  - PRACH and TDD params look consistent (mu=1, N_RB=106, band 78, SSB at 641280 → 3619.2 MHz) and align with UE PHY lines.
- **Initial mismatch**: The misconfigured AMF IPv4 is invalid. In many OAI configurations this field is in `gNBs.amf_ip_address` array; an invalid IPv4 literal can be parsed as a string token that violates libconfig grammar (e.g., not quoted or invalid IP token), triggering the CU’s libconfig error seen.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Key lines:
  - "[LIBCONFIG] ... line 91: syntax error"
  - "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded"
  - "init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed"
  - Command shows SA+rfsim with `-O .../cu_case_40.conf` → failing CU-side config file.
- Interpretation:
  - CU fails at config parse stage, so none of F1/NGAP/GTPC/GTPU initialization occurs.
  - This is consistent with an invalid token for AMF IPv4, especially if entered unquoted or outside expected range. The misconfigured value `999.999.999.999` is not a valid dotted-quad and can cause either semantic or syntactic failure depending on quoting/location.
- Cross-reference with `cu_conf` JSON:
  - Provided `cu_conf` JSON uses `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` but does not show an `amf_ip_address` object. The error case likely uses a different CU config format where `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4` must be a valid IPv4. Setting it to `999.999.999.999` would explain the parse failure seen at line 91.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- The DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly (mu=1, N_RB=106, band 78). It sets up TDD and prints SIB1 parameters.
- It starts F1AP at DU and attempts SCTP to CU: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5".
- Then repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and retries. Also: "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio".
- Impact:
  - Without CU up, F1C fails, DU keeps retrying, radio activation is deferred. In rfsim, the server-side socket for UE will not be ready.
- PRACH and PHY sections show no crash or assertion; problem is control-plane connectivity, not radio parameterization.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config matches DL/UL 3619.2 MHz, mu=1, N_RB=106; threads start.
- It runs as rfsim client and tries connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly; all attempts fail with errno 111 (connection refused).
- Interpretation:
  - The DU is not listening on rfsim server port yet because it’s waiting on F1 setup with CU. The UE’s failures are a downstream symptom of CU not starting.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline linkage:
  1) CU config parse fails immediately → CU not running.
  2) DU cannot establish F1-C to 127.0.0.5 → keeps retrying; logs say it won’t activate radio before F1 Setup Response.
  3) UE cannot connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 because DU hasn’t activated the server.
- Guided by `misconfigured_param`:
  - Invalid `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=999.999.999.999` is the primary fault.
  - In OAI configs, IPv4 literals must be valid dotted-quad; out-of-range octets violate validation and may even break libconfig parsing if provided as an unquoted token in some schema variants.
  - Therefore: the immediate root cause of the whole chain is the malformed AMF IPv4 in CU config, which prevents CU initialization entirely.
- No need to consult external specs: this is a configuration validity issue, not a 3GPP parameter mapping problem. NGAP would be the next stage impacted if CU parsed but failed to reach AMF; however, parsing fails earlier.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix the CU configuration by replacing the invalid AMF IPv4 with a real, reachable AMF address, consistent with the lab topology. Common options on a local bench:
  - If AMF runs on the same host: `127.0.0.1`
  - If AMF is reachable at the interface already used in `NETWORK_INTERFACES`: set `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4` to `192.168.8.43` (or the actual AMF host IP), and ensure routing/firewall permit SCTP 38412.
- After fixing, expected behavior:
  - CU parses and starts; F1 Setup proceeds; DU activates radio; rfsim server listens; UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043; PRACH/RRC attach starts; NGAP establishes with AMF.
- Provide corrected snippets (JSON-style) illustrating a safe configuration. These mirror the provided `network_config` and explicitly add a corrected AMF IP field consistent with the topology.

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0xe00",
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
        "tr_s_preference": "f1",
        "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
        "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3",
        "SCTP": { "SCTP_INSTREAMS": 2, "SCTP_OUTSTREAMS": 2 },
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        },
        "amf_ip_address": [
          {
            "ipv4": "192.168.8.43",  // FIX: replace invalid 999.999.999.999 with real AMF IP
            "ipv6": null,
            "active": true
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "uicc0": {
        "imsi": "001010000000001",
        "key": "fec86ba6eb707ed08905757b1bb44b8f",
        "opc": "C42449363BBAD02B66D16BC975D77CC1",
        "dnn": "oai",
        "nssai_sst": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- If AMF is local to CU, this alternative is also valid:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "amf_ip_address": [
          { "ipv4": "127.0.0.1", "ipv6": null, "active": true }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Operational checks post-fix:
  - Validate the CU config with OAI’s config linter (start CU and ensure no libconfig errors).
  - Confirm CU opens SCTP 38412 to AMF and F1-C to DU; DU should stop retrying and log F1 Setup Response; rfsim server becomes active.
  - UE should connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 without errno 111.

## 7. Limitations
- CU error log shows only a generic "syntax error" at line 91; we infer it’s caused by the invalid AMF IPv4 per the provided `misconfigured_param`. If other syntax issues exist in that file, they could also contribute.
- Provided `cu_conf` JSON schema does not include `amf_ip_address` but many OAI samples do; the failing file likely follows that schema. The fix examples cover both patterns.
- Logs are truncated and lack explicit timestamps; exact ordering is inferred from typical OAI startup sequences.
