## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The deployment is OAI 5G NR SA using RFSIM (logs show "--rfsim --sa"). Expected bring-up: process init → DU↔CU F1-C SCTP association → DU radio activation → SIB1 broadcast → UE PRACH/RACH → RRC connection → NAS registration → PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: security.integrity_algorithms[1] = nia9. OAI supports nia0/nia1/nia2/nia3; "nia9" is invalid. CU logs indeed flag: unknown integrity algorithm "nia9".
- Network configuration highlights:
  - CU: F1-C listens on 127.0.0.5:501 and expects DU at 127.0.0.3:500. AMF at 192.168.70.132, NGU/S1U at 192.168.8.43:2152. Security: integrity_algorithms ["nia2","nia9"], ciphering_algorithms ["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"].
  - DU: F1-C client to CU 127.0.0.5 (port 500→501 mapping OK), rfsimulator server mode, PHY params for n78, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106, PRACH_ConfigurationIndex 98, etc.
  - UE: SIM credentials present; RF params align with DU (3619.2 MHz, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106). UE is RFSIM client attempting 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly.
- Initial mismatch implied by misconfigured_param: invalid CU integrity algorithm prevents RRC layer setup, likely blocking CU services (including F1AP server bind/accept), cascading to DU F1-C connection failures and UE RFSIM connection failures due to DU not activating radio without F1 Setup Response.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode and build: SA mode, develop branch; RAN context shows CU-only instantiation (MAC/RLC/L1 = 0, as expected for split CU).
- Early configuration read proceeds, but a critical error appears:
  - [RRC] unknown integrity algorithm "nia9" in section "security" of the configuration file.
- Consequence: With an invalid integrity algorithm, CU RRC/security configuration is invalid. In OAI, such config errors can prevent proper initialization of RRC and higher layers, including F1AP task and SCTP server readiness. No subsequent lines confirm NGAP to AMF, nor F1AP start, suggesting CU did not reach operational state.
- Cross-reference with config: CU defines integrity_algorithms ["nia2","nia9"]. The invalid entry matches the log error exactly.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC fully: antenna ports, TDD pattern, frequencies, SIB1 parameters, and F1AP subsystem starts.
- F1AP client attempts SCTP connect to CU: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5".
- Repeated failures: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" followed by F1AP retry messages. DU explicitly waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
- Interpretation: The CU side SCTP listener is not active or crashed early. This aligns with CU's invalid security config causing CU to not bring up F1-C server.
- No PRACH/PHY assertion errors are present; the DU itself is healthy but blocked by missing CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE config matches DU RF: SCS 30 kHz, N_RB 106, 3619.2 MHz, TDD.
- UE runs as RFSIM client, attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Repeated "connect() ... failed, errno(111)" indicates the RFSIM server (the DU) did not open the port. DU defers radio bring-up and RFSIM server readiness until after F1 Setup completes.
- Therefore, UE failures are a downstream effect of DU being blocked by CU initialization failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU hits fatal config error (invalid integrity algorithm) during startup; likely does not start F1-C server.
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect to CU (connection refused), remains in "waiting for F1 Setup Response" and does not activate radio or RFSIM server.
  - UE cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 because DU’s RFSIM server isn’t up; thus UE cannot proceed to sync/PRACH.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured_param: CU `security.integrity_algorithms` includes unsupported `nia9`. OAI only supports nia0/nia1/nia2/nia3. The CU log explicitly confirms this invalid parameter.
- No evidence of PRACH/SIB/TDD misconfig; the observed end-to-end failure stems from the CU security configuration error.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix: Replace `nia9` with a valid integrity algorithm (e.g., `nia3` or remove it). Keep a valid preferred order, e.g., ["nia2","nia3","nia1","nia0"]. Ensure UE and core support the chosen algorithms (nia2 widely supported).
- After fix, verify CU starts F1AP server, DU completes F1 Setup, RFSIM server opens 4043, UE connects and proceeds with RRC attach and NAS registration.
- Optional checks:
  - Confirm CU binds to F1-C on 127.0.0.5:501 (logs should show F1AP start at CU).
  - Ensure firewalls are not blocking local loopback (for real deployments).
  - Keep `drb_integrity` consistent with policy (CU currently "no"). This does not block control-plane integrity selection; the error is from config parsing, not runtime negotiation.

Corrected snippets (JSON with inline comments to highlight changes):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "security": {
      "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
      "integrity_algorithms": [
        "nia2",   // kept: valid and commonly preferred (AES-CMAC)
        "nia3",   // changed from "nia9" to "nia3" (ZUC), valid
        "nia1",   // optional: include SNOW 3G for broader compatibility
        "nia0"    // optional: no-integrity for fallback/testing
      ],
      "drb_ciphering": "yes",
      "drb_integrity": "no"
    }
  }
}
```

No changes required for DU/UE for this specific fault. If desired, you can explicitly confirm DU’s RFSIM server settings and UE server address align:

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "server",  // DU acts as server
      "serverport": 4043
    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", // UE connects to local DU server
      "serverport": 4043
    }
  }
}
```

Post-fix validation steps:
- Start CU → check no "unknown integrity algorithm" error and verify F1AP server listening.
- Start DU → confirm F1 Setup success and "activating radio" messages; port 4043 open.
- Start UE → confirm RFSIM connection success, MIB/SIB decode, RRC->Connected, NAS Registration, PDU session.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack explicit CU F1AP startup lines; root-cause inference rests on the explicit CU error and DU connection refusals.
- Security algorithm support is based on OAI’s typical set (nia0–nia3). The provided log from CU confirms rejection of "nia9".
- No need for specification lookup for PRACH or SIB as there are no related errors; the failure is purely a CU config parse/validation issue.
