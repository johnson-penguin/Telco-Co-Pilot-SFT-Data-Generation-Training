## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsimulator. DU runs and attempts F1-C to CU; UE runs and tries to connect to the rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043. Expected flow: CU and DU load configs → F1AP association (DU↔CU) → DU activates radio → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB sync and PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.

Key input: misconfigured_param = security.drb_integrity=None. In OAI NR, `drb_integrity` is a boolean-like configuration controlling integrity protection on DRBs. Valid values are typically "yes"/"no" (or 1/0). Setting it to the literal `None` (Python-style) in a libconfig/JSON conf causes a config parse/type error.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- cu_conf.security: ciphering_algorithms [nea3, nea2, nea1, nea0]; integrity_algorithms [nia2, nia0]; drb_ciphering yes. No explicit `drb_integrity` present here (the extracted JSON likely omitted the invalid field). CU logs show a syntax error, consistent with an invalid token like `None` in the original CU conf (cu_case_87.conf).
- du_conf: NR band n78, SCS mu=1, DL/UL BW 106 PRBs, PRACH config present (`prach_ConfigurationIndex=98` etc.), F1C target CU at 127.0.0.5, local DU F1C at 127.0.0.3, rfsimulator server mode (`serveraddr: "server", port: 4043`).
- ue_conf: IMSI and credentials present; UE attempts to connect as rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Initial mismatch: CU conf fails to parse (syntax error), while DU/UE boot but cannot progress due to missing CU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- The CU immediately reports: "[LIBCONFIG] ... line 77: syntax error" and then "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded" → configuration not initialized → init aborted.
- Command line shows `--rfsim --sa -O .../cu_case_87.conf` confirming SA and rfsim modes.
- Because the CU never loads its config, no F1-C listener is started on 127.0.0.5:500. That explains subsequent DU F1AP SCTP connection refusals.
- Cross-reference: The misconfigured parameter `security.drb_integrity=None` is the likely invalid token at or around line 77 in `cu_case_87.conf` causing the syntax error. In libconfig/JSON, `None` is not a valid value; expected is "yes"/"no" (or boolean). Therefore CU does not start.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC successfully: shows TDD config, band 78, DL/UL frequencies at 3619.2 MHz, N_RB 106, and ServingCellConfigCommon parsed OK.
- DU starts F1AP: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" then repeatedly: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and retries. This is consistent with CU not binding its SCTP server due to failed config parse.
- DU remains stuck waiting: "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio". Therefore the DU never transitions to active radio state; rfsim server side for UE is not fully active at the PHY front end.
- No PRACH/PHY error appears; the issue is purely at F1AP connectivity level.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY and threads, then attempts to connect to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly. All attempts fail with errno(111) connection refused.
- This aligns with DU not accepting rfsimulator client connections until after F1 setup and activation. DU is configured as rfsim server (`serveraddr: "server"`), but it defers radio activation awaiting F1 Setup Response, which cannot occur while CU is down.
- Thus UE cannot establish RF link, preventing SSB sync/PRACH and any RRC attach.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline linkage:
  - CU fails at startup due to config syntax error → F1-C not listening on 127.0.0.5:500.
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect to CU (connection refused) → F1 Setup never completes → DU keeps radio inactive.
  - UE, acting as rfsim client, cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 (server not fully active) → repeated connection refused.
- Root cause: Invalid configuration value `security.drb_integrity=None` in CU config. In OAI, DRB integrity is optional and commonly disabled ("no"), but specifying `None` (unquoted or as an unsupported literal) breaks the config parser. The CU log’s libconfig syntax error directly supports this.
- No evidence suggests PRACH/SIB/PHY misconfiguration; DU’s PHY config appears consistent with network_config.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Replace `security.drb_integrity=None` with a supported value, e.g., `"no"` (or remove the field entirely and rely on defaults). Ensure the value type matches OAI expectations (string or boolean). After the fix, the CU should parse config, start F1-C, DU should complete F1 Setup, activate radio, and UE should connect to rfsim server.

Additional checks:
- Validate `security.integrity_algorithms` and `security.ciphering_algorithms` remain consistent (e.g., nia2 enabled; nea2/nea3 as needed).
- Confirm CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` and DU `MACRLCs` F1 addresses/ports align (they already do: CU 127.0.0.5:501/2152 vs DU 127.0.0.3:500/2152).
- After CU starts, verify DU logs show F1 Setup Response and "activating radio"; UE logs should then show successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceed to SSB detection.

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON-style for clarity; adapt to your actual conf format). The only change is adding an explicit `drb_integrity` to CU security with a valid value:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"  
      }
    },
    "du_conf": { },
    "ue_conf": { }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Use "no" for `drb_integrity` since DRB integrity is generally not applied to user plane; SRB integrity remains governed by `integrity_algorithms`.
- If your conf format is libconfig (OAI .conf), ensure proper quoting and semicolons, e.g.: `drb_integrity = "no";` inside the `security` section.

## 7. Limitations
- CU logs are truncated around the syntax error; we infer the exact line corresponds to `drb_integrity=None` per provided misconfigured_param and file reference `cu_case_87.conf`.
- The extracted `network_config.cu_conf` omits the erroneous field (likely sanitized by the extractor), so we cannot show the exact original faulty line; the diagnosis relies on CU’s parser error and the given misconfigured_param.
- No external spec lookup is required here since the failure is at config parsing (not a 3GPP behavioral mismatch). If needed, consult OAI config documentation for accepted values of `drb_integrity`.
