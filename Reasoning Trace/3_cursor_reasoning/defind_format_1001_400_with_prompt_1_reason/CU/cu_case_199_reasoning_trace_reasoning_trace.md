## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

The scenario is OAI NR SA with RF Simulator: CU, DU, and UE all run with rfsim (evidenced by CU/DU F1 over loopback addresses, DU `rfsimulator.serveraddr`, and UE repeatedly attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`). Expected bring-up flow: initialize components → CU connects to AMF (NGAP) → F1-C association between DU and CU over SCTP → DU activates radio and GTP-U (F1-U) → UE connects to RFSim server, performs cell search/SSB sync → PRACH/RA → RRC → PDU session.

The provided misconfiguration is explicit: `gNBs.local_s_address=abc.def.ghi.jkl` in CU config. This field controls the CU-side local IP address used for F1-C/F1-U bindings and listen sockets. An invalid, non-resolvable hostname/IP will cause socket creation and `getaddrinfo` failures at the CU for both F1 and GTP-U.

Key network_config parameters:
- CU `gNBs.local_s_address`: `abc.def.ghi.jkl` (invalid) and `gNBs.remote_s_address`: `127.0.0.3` (DU’s F1-C/GTP peer). `NETWORK_INTERFACES` for NG-AP/NG-U are `192.168.8.43`, which the CU uses successfully to reach the AMF and configure GTPU AMF facing address.
- DU F1-C target: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` i.e., DU expects CU control-plane at `127.0.0.5` and GTP binds to `127.0.0.3` for F1-U. RF simulator server config shows `serveraddr: "server"` and `serverport: 4043` (OAI resolves special token `server` internally to act as RFSim server endpoint).
- UE attempts RFSim client connections to `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails repeatedly with `errno(111)` (connection refused), consistent with the DU’s RFSim server not becoming active because F1 setup never completes.

Immediate mismatch anchored by misconfigured_param: CU tries to create F1 and GTP-U sockets using `abc.def.ghi.jkl` leading to name resolution failure and assertions, preventing CU F1 from starting. Consequently DU cannot connect to CU (`SCTP Connection refused`) and the UE cannot connect to RFSim server (the DU never transitions radio active).


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU starts in SA mode, configures NGAP and GTP-U NG-U towards AMF: `Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 192.168.8.43`; `Send NGSetupRequest` followed by `Received NGSetupResponse` indicates NGAP to AMF is OK.
- CU then proceeds to start F1AP: `Starting F1AP at CU` and spawns tasks.
- Critical failures:
  - `F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for abc.def.ghi.jkl` → CU attempts to bind/listen using the invalid `local_s_address`.
  - `GTPU Initializing UDP for local address abc.def.ghi.jkl` → `getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known` → `can't create GTP-U instance` → `gtpu instance id: -1`.
  - Assertion: `Assertion (getCxt(instance)->gtpInst > 0) failed! In F1AP_CU_task()` → F1-C task expects a valid F1-U listener instance; the failed GTP-U setup causes F1AP CU task to assert and exit.
  - Separate assertion in SCTP listener path: `Assertion (status == 0) failed! In sctp_create_new_listener() ... getaddrinfo() failed: Name or service not known` → confirms address resolution failure at SCTP listen() side as well.

Conclusion for CU: the invalid `local_s_address` prevents both F1-U (UDP) and F1-C (SCTP) sockets from being created; CU exits. NGAP to AMF remains unaffected because it uses `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43` which is valid.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly and computes TDD patterns, frequencies, SSB, etc. No PHY-side errors are present.
- DU attempts F1-C association: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated failures: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by F1AP retries. This is consistent with CU not listening because it terminated after address resolution assertions.
- DU notes `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` and remains stalled; therefore RF simulator server never transitions to a state where UE can proceed.

Conclusion for DU: behaves as expected but cannot complete F1 setup due to CU not listening; hence DU does not activate radio and its RFSim server side remains effectively unavailable to the UE client.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes with band/numerology consistent with DU’s configuration.
- UE operates as RFSim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, failing with `errno(111) Connection refused`.
- This indicates that no RFSim server is listening at that port (the DU side), which aligns with the DU never completing F1 setup and not activating the radio/server path.

Conclusion for UE: UE failures are a downstream symptom of CU misconfiguration blocking DU activation and RFSim server bring-up.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU succeeds with NGAP towards AMF (using valid `192.168.8.43`).
  - CU fails to set up F1-U and F1-C because it uses `gNBs.local_s_address=abc.def.ghi.jkl` → `getaddrinfo` errors → assertions → CU exits.
  - DU repeatedly attempts SCTP connect to CU at `127.0.0.5` and receives `Connection refused`, consistent with CU’s F1 listener being absent/crashed.
  - UE repeatedly fails to connect to RFSim `127.0.0.1:4043` because the DU has not activated due to missing F1 Setup Response.

- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): Invalid CU local signaling/user-plane address `abc.def.ghi.jkl`. In OAI, `gNBs.local_s_address` is used to create the listening sockets for F1-C (SCTP) and F1-U (UDP). If it is not a valid IP or resolvable hostname bound to a local interface, `getaddrinfo()` fails, leading to the exact assertions shown (`sctp_create_new_listener` and `F1AP_CU_task`).

No PRACH/PHY issues are implicated; the failure occurs at the transport/control-plane setup between CU and DU.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fix:
- Set `gNBs.local_s_address` in CU to a valid and reachable local address that matches what the DU expects for the CU endpoint. In the DU logs, the CU control-plane IP is `127.0.0.5`. Therefore, update CU `local_s_address` to `127.0.0.5` (or adjust both ends consistently). Ensure that the chosen address exists (e.g., loopback alias in RFSim setups) and that bindings are permitted.

Additional consistency checks:
- Ensure CU `remote_s_address` matches the DU’s F1-C source (`127.0.0.3`).
- Verify `NETWORK_INTERFACES` for NGAP/NGU are correct for AMF and do not conflict with F1 bindings. NGAP already works; leave as-is.
- Optionally, validate with `ping`/`ip addr` that `127.0.0.5` is acceptable in your environment; on Linux loopback, 127.0.0.0/8 is valid and routable to loopback.

Post-fix expected behavior:
- CU should create SCTP listen socket for F1-C and UDP socket for F1-U without assertions.
- DU’s repeated SCTP connect attempts should succeed; DU will receive F1 Setup Response and activate radio.
- UE should connect to RFSim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` and proceed to SSB/PRACH and RRC procedures.

  }
}
```

Verification steps after change:
- Start CU and confirm no `getaddrinfo` errors; look for `F1AP: Starting F1AP at CU` without assertions and for `SCTP listen on 127.0.0.5:501` logs if enabled.
- Start DU; `SCTP Connect` should succeed and `F1 Setup Response` should be received; DU should log radio activation.
- Start UE; RFSim connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` should succeed; proceed to PRACH and RRC.


## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; correlation is based on order and characteristic messages.
- Assumes standard OAI behavior where `gNBs.local_s_address` is used for F1-C/F1-U socket creation on CU. The observed assertions in `sctp_create_new_listener` and `F1AP_CU_task` directly support this mapping.
- Environment must support using `127.0.0.5` as a loopback address; on Linux this is valid for 127.0.0.0/8. If your platform restricts loopback to 127.0.0.1 only, use 127.0.0.1 on both ends consistently.
