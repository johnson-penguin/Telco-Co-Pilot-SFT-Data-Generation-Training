## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

Based on the logs and configuration, this is an OAI 5G SA setup using a split CU/DU with rfsimulator for the RU/UE interface:
- CU runs NGAP and GTP-U control planes and exposes F1-C toward the DU.
- DU runs MAC/PHY and attempts to connect to CU via F1-C and exposes rfsimulator server for UE.
- UE is an OAI UE using rfsimulator to connect to the DU.

Expected sequence:
1) CU initializes, binds NGAP on its NG-AMF local IP, establishes NG Setup with AMF, and starts F1 listener.
2) DU initializes, establishes F1 Setup with CU; upon success it activates radio and rfsimulator server.
3) UE connects to rfsimulator server, synchronizes, performs PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session.

Key configuration extracted from network_config:
- CU `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF`: "" (empty) ← misconfigured_param
- CU `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4`: 192.168.70.132 (AMF peer)
- CU `gNBs.local_s_address`: 127.0.0.5; DU expects CU at 127.0.0.5 for F1 (seen in DU logs)
- DU `MACRLCs.local_n_address`: 127.0.0.3; DU connects F1-C to 127.0.0.5 (CU)
- DU RF/rfsimulator configured as server on port 4043
- UE tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 (client)

Immediate mismatch flagged by misconfigured_param: CU’s NGAP local bind IP (`GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF`) is empty. This prevents CU from binding NGAP SCTP and performing NG Setup with AMF, which in turn typically blocks F1 listener startup or state progression.

Conclusion for setup: The system is blocked at the CU due to an invalid NG interface configuration; consequently, DU cannot complete F1 Setup and does not activate the radio/rfsim server, and UE cannot connect to the server.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Highlights:
- CU shows initialization in SA mode and RAN context creation but no NGAP/AMF connection success messages and no F1 listener readiness logs.
- Absence of NG Setup or NGAP bind lines is abnormal for a healthy CU.

Cross-reference with config:
- `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` is empty, so CU cannot bind its local NGAP endpoint. Without a valid local address, NGAP SCTP socket creation/bind fails, preventing NG Setup with AMF (192.168.70.132). CU then either doesn’t start F1 listener or does not transition to a state where DU can complete F1 Setup.

Inference: CU is stuck pre-NGAP or fails silently to bind NGAP, leading to knock-on failures downstream (F1 refused at CU side).

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Highlights:
- DU initialization is complete through PHY/MAC and TDD setup. It starts F1AP at DU and attempts SCTP to CU at 127.0.0.5.
- Repeated errors: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and "[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying".
- DU logs: "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" — DU stays idle and does not activate RF/rfsimulator.

Cross-reference:
- CU should be listening on F1-C to accept DU’s SCTP, but CU isn’t ready because NGAP init is broken. So DU’s SCTP connect is refused.

Inference: DU’s state is correct; it’s blocked by CU not listening/accepting F1 due to the CU NG configuration issue.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Highlights:
- UE initializes PHY and repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043 with errno(111) (connection refused).

Cross-reference:
- DU runs the rfsimulator server, but it only activates radio/server after successful F1 Setup with CU. Since F1 never completes, the DU never starts serving UE; UE’s connection attempts are refused.

Inference: UE failure is a downstream symptom of the CU-side NG configuration issue.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU fails to bind NGAP due to empty `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` → no NG Setup with AMF → CU not ready for F1.
- DU repeatedly attempts F1 SCTP to CU at 127.0.0.5 → connection refused (CU not listening/ready) → DU holds radio inactive.
- UE attempts to connect to rfsim server → connection refused since DU never activates the server.

Root cause guided by misconfigured_param:
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=""` in CU config.
- Correct behavior: This field must be set to the CU host’s local IPv4 address reachable by the AMF (same L3 domain as AMF 192.168.70.132). Commonly, OAI examples use an interface on the 192.168.70.0/24 subnet (e.g., 192.168.70.141). It may also be the same IP used for NG-U (`GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU`) if control/data share the interface; however, it must be a valid local address, not empty.

Spec/code basis:
- NGAP requires a valid local bind address for SCTP association establishment toward AMF (3GPP TS 38.413 describes NGAP transport over SCTP/IP; implementation requires socket bind to a local IP). In OAI, an empty local NG address results in bind/listen failures and no NG Setup.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Primary fix:
- Set `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` to a valid CU host IP reachable by AMF (same subnet or routed). If your CU host’s interface IP is `192.168.8.43`, you can reuse it for NG-AMF; alternatively, if you have a dedicated AMF subnet (e.g., `192.168.70.x`), use that local IP (e.g., `192.168.70.141`). The key is that the address must exist on the CU and be able to reach `amf_ip_address.ipv4=192.168.70.132`.

After the change, expected behavior:
1) CU binds NGAP and completes NG Setup with AMF.
2) CU enables/accepts F1; DU’s SCTP connect succeeds, F1 Setup Response arrives, DU activates radio and rfsim server.
3) UE connects to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043, proceeds to PRACH, RRC attach, registration, and PDU session.

Validated configuration snippets (proposed):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "amf_ip_address": { "ipv4": "192.168.70.132" },
      "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
        // FIX: set to a valid CU host IP that can reach AMF
        // Example A (reuse NG-U interface on 192.168.8.0/24):
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",
        // If your AMF is reachable via 192.168.70.0/24 and the CU has that IP,
        // alternatively use something like "192.168.70.141" instead.
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
        "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
      },
      // Optional: ensure CU’s F1 addresses match DU expectations (already correct here)
      "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
      "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3"
    }
  }
}
```

No changes are required to `du_conf` for this specific issue, but you can verify F1 addressing is consistent (it is: DU connects to CU 127.0.0.5). UE configuration is fine for rfsim; it will work once the DU activates the server.

Operational checks after applying the fix:
- On CU: look for NGAP bind/start and NG Setup success messages.
- On DU: look for successful SCTP association to CU and F1 Setup Response, followed by radio activation.
- On UE: verify rfsim connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds and registration proceeds.

Further diagnostics if problems persist:
- Ensure host routing/firewall allows CU↔AMF reachability on SCTP (NGAP default port 38412).
- Confirm the chosen `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` exists on the CU host (`ip addr`/`ifconfig`).
- If AMF is remote (e.g., docker/network namespace), verify bridge/NAT rules and that AMF listens on the provided IP.

## 7. Limitations

- CU logs are truncated and do not show explicit NGAP errors; the diagnosis is inferred from the empty NG local IP, lack of NG Setup, and cascading DU/UE failures.
- Timestamps are absent, so exact timing cannot be correlated, but causal ordering is clear from repeated connection refusals.
- The fix assumes standard OAI behavior where F1 readiness depends on CU NG initialization; if a custom fork decouples this, still, NGAP must be fixed to reach a functional network.
