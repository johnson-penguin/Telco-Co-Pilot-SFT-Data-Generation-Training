## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- Environment: OAI NR standalone (SA) with RF simulator, indicated by CU/DU/UE logs showing "--rfsim" and "--sa". Expected call flow: CU/DU init → F1-C association (SCTP) → DU activates radio → UE connects to rfsim server (port 4043) → PRACH/RACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: security.ciphering_algorithms[2] = "nea9" (in CU `gnb.conf`). OAI supports NEA0/1/2/3; "nea9" is invalid. CU log already flags: unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9".
- High-level hypothesis: CU fails to fully initialize RRC/config due to invalid ciphering algorithm, never accepting F1 setup; DU repeatedly retries SCTP to CU and never activates radio; UE cannot connect to rfsim server because DU radio remains inactive or CU/DU stack not ready.
- Network configuration key points parsed:
  - CU `gNBs`: F1-C local 127.0.0.5, remote 127.0.0.3; AMF at 192.168.70.132; NGU/S1U 2152.
  - CU `security.ciphering_algorithms`: ["nea3", "nea2", "nea9", "nea0"] → contains invalid entry.
  - DU `MACRLCs`: F1 local 127.0.0.3, remote 127.0.0.5 (matches CU); `servingCellConfigCommon` shows FR1 n78, SCS 30 kHz (mu=1), BW 106 PRB, PRACH config index 98 (sane), TDD pattern set, SIB1 TDA 15.
  - DU `rfsimulator`: server mode on port 4043.
  - UE: no explicit rfsim config here, but logs show client connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Immediate mismatch: invalid CU ciphering algorithm causes early RRC config error, consistent with CU log. This can block CU’s F1 and higher-layer readiness, cascading to DU SCTP failures and UE rfsim connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode/version:
  - "running in SA mode"; OAI develop hash b2c9a1d2b5 (May 20, 2025). CU context initialized with MAC/RLC/L1 instances at 0 (expected for CU split).
- Identity:
  - F1AP CU id 3584; name gNB-Eurecom-CU.
- Critical error:
  - [RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9" in section "security" of the configuration file.
- Config processing continues (GNBSParams, SCTPParams, Events) but there is no evidence of NGAP to AMF or F1AP listener establishment in these snippets. In practice, an invalid security profile may prevent proper RRC/N2 setup and F1 handling at CU.
- Cross-check with CU config: `security.ciphering_algorithms` indeed contains "nea9" at index 2. OAI validates names; unrecognized entries are rejected.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU init healthy: L1/MAC threads, antenna ports set, minTXRXTIME 6, SIB1 TDA 15, TDD pattern resolved (8 DL, 3 UL in 10-slot period for mu=1). PHY frequencies: DL/UL 3619200000 Hz (n78), BW 106 PRB.
- ServingCellConfigCommon and derived parameters are consistent: absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz; PointA 640008; mu=1; PRACH config present; no PHY asserts or PRACH errors in this excerpt.
- F1AP:
  - DU attempts to connect F1-C to CU at 127.0.0.5; repeated SCTP connect failed: Connection refused; DU retries; GNB_APP waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio. This shows CU is not accepting SCTP on expected port because CU didn’t reach a ready state.
- GTPU initialized locally (127.0.0.3:2152), but radio activation is gated behind F1 Setup; thus rfsim PHY service likely not fully active for UE to attach procedures.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE PHY configured to DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, mu=1, BW 106 → matches DU frequencies.
- UE acts as rfsim client attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043; repeated connect() failed errno(111) (connection refused). In OAI rfsim, DU/gNB runs the server on 4043. Because DU delays activation pending F1 Setup (which is blocked by CU readiness), the rfsim server isn’t accepting connections yet, causing UE failures.
- No PRACH/RA attempts occur because link-level connectivity to rfsim server never establishes.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU flags invalid ciphering algorithm and does not progress to a state that listens for F1-C SCTP. DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU. Without F1 Setup Response, DU won’t activate radio/rfsim server, so UE cannot connect to 4043 and loops on connection refused.
- Misconfigured parameter as causal anchor: `security.ciphering_algorithms[2] = "nea9"` at CU.
  - OAI supports NEA0/NEA1/NEA2/NEA3. "nea9" is not defined and is explicitly rejected by CU RRC, seen in logs.
  - This prevents proper RRC and possibly overall CU app configuration completion leading to F1 listener not established.
- Non-issues to rule out (from logs/config):
  - PRACH configuration seems valid (index 98, ZCZC 13, msg1 SCS 30kHz) and no PHY assert logs on DU.
  - IP/ports for F1 match between CU (127.0.0.5) and DU (127.0.0.3) with proper port numbers. GTPU configured as expected.
  - Frequency/TDD settings are consistent between DU and UE.
- Root cause: Invalid ciphering algorithm entry in CU `gnb.conf` (`nea9`) causes CU configuration error, preventing CU from becoming operational; this blocks DU F1 setup and, in turn, UE rfsim connectivity.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Immediate fix at CU:
  - Replace/remove the invalid "nea9" from `security.ciphering_algorithms`. A safe list is a subset of {"nea0","nea1","nea2","nea3"}. Typical order: prefer NEA2 or NEA1/3, keep NEA0 (no ciphering) last if needed for testing.
- Optional alignments/checks:
  - Ensure `integrity_algorithms` include supported set {"nia0","nia1","nia2"}; currently ["nia2","nia0"] is fine.
  - After fixing, confirm CU starts NGAP association to AMF (logs should show NGAP SCTP up) and is listening on F1-C; DU should receive F1 Setup Response; DU will activate radio; UE should connect to rfsim 4043 successfully.
- Diagnostic steps post-fix:
  - On CU: look for logs indicating F1-C listener established and NGAP connected to AMF.
  - On DU: verify F1 Setup completion and "activating radio" message; ensure no SCTP retries.
  - On UE: confirm rfsim TCP handshake success, then PRACH/RACH and RRC procedures proceed.

- Corrected configuration snippets (JSON with inline comments to highlight changes):
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": [
          "nea2",   // changed: removed invalid "nea9"; prefer NEA2 first
          "nea3",   // kept: valid
          "nea1",   // added: valid alternative
          "nea0"    // kept: optional no-ciphering fallback
        ],
        "integrity_algorithms": [
          "nia2",
          "nia0"
        ],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      // no change required for DU security for this issue; DU's F1 IPs already match CU
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // UE security handled internally; no change required for this issue
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial and do not include full CU startup (e.g., explicit F1 listener bind or NGAP messages) nor explicit error termination, but the presence of the explicit CU RRC error about "nea9" plus DU SCTP "connection refused" is sufficient to attribute causality.
- UE configuration snippet does not show rfsim parameters, but logs confirm client target 127.0.0.1:4043; failure is consistent with DU not activating server pending F1.
- The recommendation relies on OAI’s known supported algorithm names; if using a custom fork, verify accepted enumerations in OAI’s RRC/PDCP security configuration parser.
