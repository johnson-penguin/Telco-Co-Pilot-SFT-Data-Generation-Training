## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs indicate an OAI 5G SA deployment using rfsimulator:
- CU and DU started with `--rfsim --sa` (seen in CU CMDLINE and DU PHY/MAC init) and UE attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` as an rfsim client.
- Expected flow: CU loads config → F1AP setup with DU → CU connects to AMF (NGAP) → DU activates radio after F1 SETUP → UE connects to rfsim server, detects SSB → PRACH → RRC → PDU session.

The provided misconfiguration is explicit: `gNBs.plmn_list.mnc_length=9999999`. In OAI, `mnc_length` must be 2 or 3. The CU log confirms config validation failure and immediate exit.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs.plmn_list: `mcc=1, mnc=1, mnc_length=9999999` → invalid (only 2 or 3 allowed). CU IPs: `local_s_address 127.0.0.5`, DU peer `remote_s_address 127.0.0.3`.
- du_conf.gNBs[0].plmn_list[0]: `mcc=1, mnc=1, mnc_length=2` → valid. DU F1-C tries CU `127.0.0.5` and binds to `127.0.0.3` per logs.
- ue_conf.uicc0: IMSI `001010000000001` with `nssai_sst=1` compatible with network S-NSSAI.

Initial mismatch: CU uses invalid `mnc_length` and exits before F1 setup. DU cannot connect to CU F1-C; UE cannot connect to rfsim server (DU delays radio activation pending F1 setup).

Implication: The root cause is a CU-side PLMN encoding configuration error that blocks the entire chain at the earliest stage.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key CU log lines:
- "[UTIL] running in SA mode" and build info → normal startup.
- "[GNB_APP] Initialized RAN Context … F1AP: gNB_CU_id … name gNB-Eurecom-CU" → early app init.
- "[CONFIG] config_check_intval: mnc_length: 9999999 invalid value, authorized values: 2 3" → hard validation failure.
- "[ENB_APP][CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value" → config checker flagged one invalid parameter.
- "config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun" → CU terminates during configuration phase, before starting F1AP/NGAP.

Cross-reference with `cu_conf.gNBs.plmn_list.mnc_length=9999999`: matches precisely. No further CU progress (no SCTP to AMF, no F1AP listener), so CU is effectively down.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
DU proceeds through PHY/MAC/RRC initialization, confirms TDD config and frequencies. Crucial control-plane observations:
- F1AP startup: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" consistent with `du_conf.MACRLCs[0].remote_n_address` and `cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address`.
- Repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and "Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3) … retrying" → DU cannot establish F1-C SCTP because CU is not listening (it exited).
- "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" → DU keeps radio inactive until F1 SETUP completes, thus no rfsim server exposure to UE.

No PHY/MAC crash signatures; the DU is healthy but blocked on control-plane connectivity to the CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
UE RF/PHY config aligns with DU: DL/UL 3.6192 GHz, SCS 30 kHz (mu=1), N_RB 106.
Connectivity:
- "Running as client … rfsimulator" and repeated attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` all fail with errno(111) (connection refused).
- This indicates the rfsim server is not up. In OAI with rfsimulator, the gNB (DU or RU process) hosts the server endpoint; it stays blocked until F1 SETUP activates radio. Since CU exited, DU never activates radio and hence no server is listening on 4043.

Conclusion: UE failures are a downstream symptom of CU exit.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU terminates during config validation due to invalid `mnc_length` (must be 2 or 3, not 9999999).
  - DU repeatedly fails F1-C SCTP to CU `127.0.0.5` because the CU is down.
  - DU waits for F1 SETUP RESPONSE before activating radio; therefore rfsim server port is not opened.
  - UE cannot connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` rfsim server and loops forever with connection refused.

- Root cause: Misconfigured `gNBs.plmn_list.mnc_length` in CU config. According to 3GPP TS 23.003 (identifiers), MNC is either 2 or 3 digits; implementations require `mnc_length` ∈ {2,3}. OAI's config checker enforces this, and the CU exits when invalid.

- No other DU/UE parameters show blocking issues; PRACH, TDD, and frequencies look internally consistent. The only gating failure is the CU config validation.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix:
- Set `cu_conf.gNBs.plmn_list.mnc_length` to 2 or 3 (matching the actual `mnc` value). Given `mnc: 1`, choose `mnc_length: 2` and represent MNC as `01`, or set `mnc: 1` with `mnc_length: 3` (→ `001`). Ensure CU and DU agree on PLMN broadcast (MCC/MNC/length) to avoid RRC SIB decoding issues on UE.

After change, expected behavior:
- CU completes config, starts F1AP and NGAP.
- DU establishes F1-C SCTP, receives F1 SETUP RESPONSE, activates radio, starts rfsim server.
- UE connects to rfsim server, proceeds with SSB detection, PRACH, and RRC.

  }
}
```

Operational checks after fix:
- Start CU first and verify no config errors; confirm it listens for F1-C on `127.0.0.5`.
- Start DU; ensure F1 SETUP completes and radio activates (no more "waiting for F1 Setup Response").
- Verify rfsim server is listening on port 4043; UE should connect without errno(111).
- Optional: If using external AMF, confirm `NETWORK_INTERFACES` and `amf_ip_address` are reachable.

Further analysis (if issues persist after fix):
- Confirm PLMN broadcast in SIB1 (RRC logs) matches UE `imsi` MCC/MNC and `mnc_length`.
- Validate that DU/CU `gNB_ID`, `nr_cellid`, and F1 addresses match as configured.
- Check that SSB frequency, SCS, and bandwidth align (they do in the provided DU/UE logs).

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; we infer sequence from message order.
- Only one explicit misconfiguration is provided; other latent issues (e.g., AMF reachability) are not exercised because CU exits early.
- Spec citation is based on known constraints (3GPP TS 23.003: MNC length 2 or 3) and OAI config validation behavior; no web lookup was required.
