## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The setup is OAI NR SA with RF simulator, as indicated by use of "--rfsim" and "--sa" and the UE trying to reach rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU loads config → starts F1-C server and NGAP towards AMF → DU connects via F1AP/SCTP and, after F1 Setup, activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim, acquires SSB, performs RA → RRC/NAS attach and PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter: gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=999.999.999.999 (CU). This is not a valid IPv4 address. The CU logs instead show a libconfig syntax error and failure to load the configuration, which blocks CU startup.
- network_config summaries:
  - cu_conf.gNBs has no explicit `amf_ip_address` object in the provided JSON, but does have `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF = 192.168.8.43` and NGU also 192.168.8.43. The error scenario JSON (outside this extracted `network_config`) sets `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4` to an invalid value, which likely caused the parsing failure.
  - du_conf parameters are sane and consistent with logs (FR1 n78, µ=1, BW=106 PRBs, PRACH idx 98). DU uses F1-C CU 127.0.0.5; DU IP 127.0.0.3.
  - ue_conf IMSI 001010000000001, SST 1; UE attempts rfsim connection to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Initial mismatch: CU configuration is syntactically or semantically invalid due to the malformed AMF IP field. CU fails to start, so F1 does not come up; DU cannot connect to CU; rfsim server is not started; UE connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 is refused repeatedly.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- The CU does not reach normal initialization. Key messages:
  - "[LIBCONFIG] ... line 91: syntax error" → the configuration file contains an invalid token/format at that line.
  - "config module 'libconfig' couldn't be loaded" and multiple "config module not properly initialized" lines → configuration parsing failed early.
  - "function config_libconfig_init returned -1" → hard failure, CU exits.
- Relation to misconfigured_param: Setting `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4` to an invalid IPv4 (e.g., 999.999.999.999) can lead to:
  - If provided as a bare token or incorrect type in libconfig syntax, a parser error (syntax error) at the line.
  - If provided as a string but validated by OAI, an immediate config_execcheck failure. Here the logs point to a parse error, matching the misconfigured parameter breaking the config file at that location.
- Cross-reference with network_config: This extracted `cu_conf` uses `NETWORK_INTERFACES.*` to set AMF/NGU addresses, which is valid. The failing run used an alternative field `amf_ip_address.ipv4` with an invalid value, causing the parser to abort before any F1/NGAP setup.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU and configures radio parameters correctly (n78 at 3.6192 GHz, µ=1, BW 106). It starts F1AP and attempts SCTP to CU at 127.0.0.5.
- Repeated failures:
  - "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" followed by retries and "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio".
- Since CU never started due to config parse failure, there is no listener on 127.0.0.5 F1-C → DU cannot complete F1 Setup → DU keeps radio inactive and rfsim server not started.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initialization is normal (FR1, µ=1, BW 106). UE acts as rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Repeated "connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)" → rfsim server is not active.
- Cause: DU defers radio/rfsim activation until after F1 Setup Response. With CU down, the server never starts.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU fails to load config due to syntax error at the line where `amf_ip_address.ipv4` is misconfigured.
  - DU keeps retrying F1 SCTP to CU and never receives F1 Setup Response.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim because DU did not activate it without F1 Setup.
- Root cause: Invalid AMF IPv4 value (`999.999.999.999`) in CU configuration, most likely entered in the `amf_ip_address.ipv4` field with incorrect syntax or invalid value, causing libconfig parse failure. Even if parsing succeeded, OAI would reject an out-of-range IPv4 during validation. The correct configuration must specify a valid IPv4 address and, in OAI, either use `amf_ip_address.ipv4` or `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF`, but not conflicting/invalid entries.
- Additional sanity checks:
  - The extracted `cu_conf` uses `NETWORK_INTERFACES` with 192.168.8.43 for NG-AMF; ensure this IP is reachable to the AMF host. However, this is a later-stage concern; current failure is at parse time.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Config fixes (pick one consistent method):
  - Prefer modern `NETWORK_INTERFACES` and remove/omit the legacy `amf_ip_address` block.
  - Or, if using `amf_ip_address`, ensure it contains a valid IPv4 address string.
- Corrected snippets within the same network_config structure:

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      // Option A: rely solely on NETWORK_INTERFACES (recommended)
      // Remove invalid amf_ip_address block entirely in the actual config file
      "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43", // keep valid IP
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
        "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      // Option B: if amf_ip_address is used, it must be valid and properly formatted
      "amf_ip_address": { "ipv4": "192.168.70.132" } // FIX: use a valid IPv4; quotes required
    }
  }
}
```

- Verification steps after change:
  - Validate config syntax: start CU and ensure libconfig initializes without syntax errors.
  - If both `amf_ip_address` and `NETWORK_INTERFACES` are present, keep them consistent or remove the deprecated one to avoid ambiguity.
  - Start DU; confirm F1 Setup completes and radio activation (and rfsim server) occur.
  - UE should connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceed with SSB/RA/RRC.
  - Test NGAP registration with AMF; verify NGAP SCTP association and PDU session setup.
- Further diagnostics if issues persist:
  - Increase CU `Asn1_verbosity` to `annoying` for more trace (post-parse stage).
  - Confirm route/reachability to AMF IP and firewall rules.
  - Ensure no conflicting entries in config (duplicate sections or malformed commas/braces in libconfig syntax if using `.conf`).

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; exact line 91 contents are not shown, so we infer linkage between the misconfigured AMF IP and the syntax error based on the provided misconfigured_param and typical OAI behavior.
- Extracted `network_config` JSON may not reflect all fields present in the failing `.conf`. The fix shows both accepted approaches; apply one consistently.
- No external tool lookup needed; the failure is explicit: configuration parsing aborts, which is expected when an IPv4 is malformed or unquoted in libconfig.
