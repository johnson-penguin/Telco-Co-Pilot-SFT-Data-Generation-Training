## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The scenario is OAI NR SA using the RF simulator. CU and DU run split-F1 ("tr_s_preference": "f1"), and the UE connects to the DU’s RF simulator endpoint.
- Expected bring-up: CU loads config → validates gNB parameters → starts NGAP/AMF, F1C endpoint → DU initializes PHY/MAC → establishes F1C with CU → DU activates radio and starts rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server → performs SSB detection → RACH/RA-RNTI → RRC → PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: gNBs.tracking_area_code=9999999 (on CU). TAC is used in core-related selections and F1/N2 announcements but, critically here, OAI performs strict range validation on load.
- From CU logs: config_check_intrange flags tracking_area_code 9999999 as invalid (range 1..65533) and exits. Therefore CU never creates the F1C endpoint. DU subsequently cannot connect via SCTP, and UE cannot connect to rfsim server because DU delays full radio activation while waiting for F1 setup.
- Network config summary:
  - gnb_conf (CU): `tracking_area_code: 9999999` (invalid), `local_s_address: 127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address: 127.0.0.3`, AMF IPv4 present, NGU/S1U set to 192.168.8.43.
  - du_conf (DU): `tracking_area_code: 1` (valid), PHY set for n78, 106 PRBs, TDD config valid, F1C intends to connect to CU at 127.0.0.5:501 per MACRLC `remote_n_portc`.
  - ue_conf (UE): IMSI/DNN standard; RF simulator client tries 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Immediate mismatch: CU TAC invalid and not aligned with DU TAC. Because CU aborts, the bring-up halts upstream of radio activation.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Key lines:
  - "running in SA mode" confirms SA run.
  - "config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 9999999 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533" → hard validation failure.
  - "config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value" and then exit path "config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun".
- Consequence: CU never starts F1AP listener at 127.0.0.5:501/ SCTP, NGAP not brought up; no AMF handshake occurs. This is consistent with zero NGAP/F1AP operational entries in CU logs.
- Cross-ref: In CU `network_config.gNBs.tracking_area_code` is 9999999, matching the error and causing immediate termination.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Initialization proceeds normally: PHY/MAC parameters for n78/TDD; PDSCH/PUSCH ports; SIB1, CSI-RS/SRS; frequencies set to 3619.2 MHz; frame params consistent for μ=1, 106 PRBs.
- F1AP bring-up at DU:
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" then repeated "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" with retries.
  - DU prints "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio". Hence rfsim server and radio activation are gated on F1 setup success.
- No PHY crashes or PRACH issues: DU is simply blocked by missing CU listener. This aligns with CU having exited at config time.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config matches DU PHY numerology and frequency (3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, μ=1). It acts as rfsim client.
- Repeated failures to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 with errno(111) (connection refused). In OAI rfsim, the DU typically runs the server at that port/address, and it only starts listening after radio activation.
- Since DU is waiting for F1 Setup Response that never comes (CU exited), the DU never activates the radio nor starts the rfsim server, so the UE’s connection attempts fail.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline:
  - CU exits immediately due to invalid TAC value during config validation.
  - DU repeatedly attempts F1 SCTP connect to CU and is refused because CU is not running.
  - UE attempts to connect to the rfsim server that the DU would host post-radio activation; connection refused because DU hasn’t activated radio (blocked by missing F1 setup).
- Root cause: Misconfigured `tracking_area_code` on CU (`9999999`), outside allowed range per OAI check (1..65533). The mismatch versus DU TAC (=1) is secondary; the hard failure is the out-of-range value causing CU termination.
- 3GPP perspective: TAC is a 16-bit value (see 3GPP TS 23.003/38.413 contexts), and OAI constrains it to the valid range. Using an out-of-range TAC breaks CU initialization logic and prevents F1/NGAP setup.
- Therefore, all downstream symptoms (DU SCTP refused; UE rfsim connect refused) are cascading effects of CU’s early exit.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Correct the CU `tracking_area_code` to a valid value within [1, 65533]. Align it with DU’s TAC to avoid paging/TA-based mismatch issues. Example: set CU TAC to 1.
- After fixing, verify:
  - CU starts NGAP and F1AP and listens on 127.0.0.5:501.
  - DU completes F1 Setup, prints activation messages, and starts rfsim server.
  - UE succeeds connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043, then detects SSB and proceeds to RACH/RRC attach.
- Optional sanity checks:
  - Ensure CU/DU PLMN match (both MCC/MNC 1/1/2 already OK).
  - Confirm AMF IP/NGU IP reachability if using real core; for rfsim local tests it may be moot, but no harm validating.

- If issues persist after the fix:
  - Check that CU logs show F1AP started and no further config_execcheck failures.
  - Confirm DU F1 Setup Response received and radio activated (look for "Activating gNB" or similar messages).
  - Ensure no port conflicts on 127.0.0.1:4043 and that firewall rules allow localhost sockets.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; precise ordering is inferred from typical OAI bring-up.
- Only one explicit validation error is shown; other potential misconfigs may be present but masked until CU passes config checks.
- The JSON snippets above are illustrative deltas, not full configs; ensure other parameters remain consistent with your deployment.
