## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The logs indicate OAI NR SA mode with RF Simulator: both CU/DU show "running in SA mode" and DU has `rfsimulator` configured with `serverport: 4043`; UE attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected bring-up: CU initializes and listens for F1-C (SCTP) → DU connects over F1-C → DU activates radio and starts rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB sync → PRACH/RACH → RRC → NAS registration.
- Provided misconfiguration: `security.ciphering_algorithms[2]=nea9` (in CU config). OAI supports NEA0/NEA1/NEA2/NEA3; `nea9` is invalid for CU RRC security config.
- Network config parsing (key fields):
  - CU `gNBs`: `local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address=127.0.0.3`, SCTP streams 2/2, AMF IPv4 `192.168.70.132`. Security: `ciphering_algorithms=["nea3","nea2","nea9","nea0"]`, `integrity_algorithms=["nia2","nia0"]`.
  - DU `gNBs[0]`: F1 `local_n_address=127.0.0.3` toward CU `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5`. Serving cell config consistent with band n78, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs; PRACH index 98; TDD pattern matches log. RFsim server mode: `serveraddr: "server"`, `serverport: 4043`.
  - UE: USIM credentials present; no explicit rfsim client override, so defaults appear to target `127.0.0.1:4043` per logs.
- Initial mismatch: CU logs contain `[RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9"` which directly aligns with the misconfigured parameter in `security.ciphering_algorithms`. This would prevent proper RRC security configuration and likely abort or leave CU partially initialized, impacting F1-C.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Key lines:
  - SA mode confirmed; build info printed.
  - RAN Context shows CU-only instance (MAC/RLC/L1 counts 0, expected for CU split): `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0`.
  - Critically: `[RRC]   unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9" in section "security" of the configuration file`.
  - Config parsing continues for multiple sections (`GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, etc.). No evidence of F1-C listener started nor NGAP/AMF connection lines; absence suggests CU did not reach operational state after the security error.
- Cross-reference with network_config:
  - CU `security.ciphering_algorithms` indeed includes `nea9` at index 2, matching the error. OAI expects names: `nea0`, `nea1`, `nea2`, `nea3`.
  - DU experiences repeated SCTP connection refusals to CU (see DU logs), consistent with CU not opening its F1-C SCTP server due to configuration error.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Initialization proceeds normally: PHY/MAC initialized; TDD and carrier config match `servingCellConfigCommon` parameters; frequencies 3.6192 GHz; N_RB 106; SIB1 and antenna ports printed.
- F1AP startup attempts:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` aligns with CU/DU IPs in configs.
  - Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by F1AP retries. This indicates no process is listening on CU's F1-C port (500/501 per config), or CU refused due to not being fully started.
- DU waits: `[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → radio and thus rfsim server are not activated.
- No PHY/MAC fatal errors appear; the block is orchestration (F1-C) rather than PHY.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY consistent with DU cell (N_RB 106, DL 3.6192 GHz, TDD, SCS 30 kHz).
- UE acts as RFsim client: `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` with repeated `errno(111)` connection refused.
- This is explained by DU not starting the rfsim server because it is waiting for F1 Setup (CU not ready). Hence UE cannot connect at all.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU hits security config error due to `nea9` in `ciphering_algorithms` → CU likely fails to complete RRC/security init and does not bring up F1-C server.
  - DU attempts F1-C SCTP to CU at `127.0.0.5` and is refused repeatedly → DU remains in pre-activation state waiting for F1 Setup Response.
  - DU therefore does not start RFsim radio server → UE's repeated TCP connection attempts to `127.0.0.1:4043` are refused.
- Root cause driven by misconfigured_param: invalid ciphering algorithm `nea9` in CU `security.ciphering_algorithms`. OAI only supports NEA0/1/2/3; any other token is rejected by RRC config parsing.
- External knowledge (3GPP and OAI):
  - 3GPP TS 33.501 Annex D specifies NEA0/1/2/3 for 5G NR user plane ciphering; there is no NEA9.
  - OAI configuration parser validates algorithm names against known strings; unknown entries emit an RRC error and can abort or degrade CU startup.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Configuration fix (primary): remove or replace `nea9` with a supported algorithm, e.g., `nea1`. Typical order preference is strongest-first: `nea2`, `nea1`, `nea0`, `nea3` (or include all four supported).
- After fix, expected recovery path: CU starts properly and opens F1-C → DU connects and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio and starts rfsim server on 4043 → UE connects, synchronizes, and proceeds with RACH/RRC.
- Verification steps:
  - Restart CU and confirm no `[RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm` error appears; observe F1AP/NGAP startup logs.
  - On DU, confirm F1 Setup completes and radio activation occurs; observe `rfsimulator` server listening and UE connects.
  - On UE, confirm successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and subsequent SSB detection and RACH.
- Corrected configuration snippets (only fields relevant to the issue shown):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": [
          "nea3",
          "nea2",
          "nea1",
          "nea0"
        ],
        "integrity_algorithms": [
          "nia2",
          "nia0"
        ],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {},
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
}
```

- Optional hardening:
  - Keep only supported algorithm strings across all configs; avoid typos or non-standard names.
  - Ensure CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` addresses are reachable to AMF (not blocking bring-up here, but good hygiene).

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not show CU explicitly aborting or F1AP listener status; the conclusion relies on the explicit RRC error and the DU's repeated SCTP refusals to CU, plus UE's rfsim connection failures.
- No timestamps are provided; sequencing inferred from typical OAI bring-up order and inter-component dependencies.
- The DU/UE configurations appear otherwise coherent; if issues persist after fixing CU security algorithms, further checks should validate F1 ports (500/501), firewall rules, and rfsim server binding behavior.
