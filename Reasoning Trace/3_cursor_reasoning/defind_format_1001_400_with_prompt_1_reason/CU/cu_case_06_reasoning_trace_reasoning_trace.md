## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- OAI NR SA with rfsimulator: CU log shows `--rfsim --sa`; DU uses `rfsimulator.serverport:4043`; UE tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly.
- Expected bring-up flow in SA+rfsim:
  1) CU loads config, starts NGAP (AMF), F1-C listener, waits for DU F1-Setup.
  2) DU loads config, starts F1-C client to CU; upon F1-Setup success, activates radio (rfsim server) and PHY/MAC.
  3) UE connects to rfsim server (DU), acquires SSB, performs PRACH, RRC, and PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.tracking_area_code=invalid_string` (CU side). CU logs confirm: `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 0 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533` leading to immediate exit.
- Network config snapshot:
  - cu_conf.gNBs: has F1 IPs (`local_s_address:127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address:127.0.0.3`), AMF IPs, but does not show `tracking_area_code`. The runtime CU config referenced by logs (CLI `-O .../cu_case_06.conf`) evidently had an invalid TAC string which parsed to 0 and failed range check.
  - du_conf.gNBs[0]: `tracking_area_code: 1` (valid), PRACH config (index 98), band n78, SCS 30 kHz, BW 106 PRB, TDD pattern OK.
  - ue_conf: basic UICC and DNN; no RF mismatches observed (UE tuned to 3619.2 MHz consistent with DU).
- Early mismatch: CU TAC invalid → CU exits; DU cannot complete F1; rfsim server activation is gated on F1-Setup → UE cannot connect to rfsim server (errno 111 connection refused).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key lines:
- `[UTIL] running in SA mode ...` and build info: normal.
- `[GNB_APP] Initialized RAN Context: ... RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` (CU has no MAC/L1 in split F1 mode, expected).
- `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 0 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533` → hard validation failure.
- `[ENB_APP] [CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` → CU terminates.
- `config_userapi.c:102 config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` → confirms CU abort before opening F1-C or NGAP sockets.
Cross-ref with cu_conf:
- The provided `cu_conf` JSON lacks `tracking_area_code`; OAI default validator requires TAC within [1..65533]. The live config `cu_case_06.conf` had an invalid string for TAC, causing parse to integer 0 and failing the intrange check.
- CU therefore never binds F1-C (127.0.0.5:500/501) nor connects to AMF.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Initialization and configuration:
- PHY/MAC/RRC initialization normal for n78, 106 PRB, µ=1, TDD pattern derived and applied. PRACH, SIB1 parameters logged; TAC echoed later in F1 setup message context as 1 (valid on DU side).
- F1 setup attempts:
  - `F1AP: F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with retry loops, plus `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
Consequence:
- Without CU listening, F1 association cannot be established. DU holds radio activation (and thus rfsimulator server thread) until F1-Setup success.
- Therefore no rfsim server is available on 4043 for UE to connect.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- RF setup aligns with DU: `DL freq 3619200000`, `N_RB_DL 106`, µ=1.
- Repeated rfsim client attempts: `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` → `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` looping.
- This is consistent with DU not having activated the rfsim server due to missing F1-Setup.
- No PRACH/RRC attempts occur because UE cannot connect to the simulated RF transport.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU aborts early due to invalid `tracking_area_code` in its `gNBs` section (string → parsed 0; OAI validator range [1..65533]).
- DU, configured correctly, attempts F1-C connection to CU at 127.0.0.5 but is refused because CU is not running.
- DU logs explicitly wait for F1 Setup Response before activating radio; rfsim server remains unavailable.
- UE runs as rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043 and fails with ECONNREFUSED repeatedly.
Root cause:
- Misconfigured `gNBs.tracking_area_code` in CU configuration (non-numeric string), violating OAI’s intrange check, causes CU exit and cascades into DU F1 failures and UE rfsim connection refusals.
Standards/context:
- TAC identifies a Tracking Area; implementations typically accept values 1..65533 (non-zero, below max). OAI enforces this via config checks. When TAC is invalid on the CU (central node exporting NG setup and F1 params), it quits during configuration validation.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix:
- Set CU `gNBs.tracking_area_code` to a valid integer matching DU (e.g., 1). Ensure numeric type, not string.
- Verify CU starts NGAP and F1-C; check that DU reaches `F1 Setup Response received; activating radio` and that UE can connect to rfsim server.

Operational validation steps:
- Start CU; confirm no `[CONFIG] ... tracking_area_code` errors; verify F1-C listening on 127.0.0.5.
- Start DU; observe F1 SCTP connects and `F1 Setup Response` received; see `activating radio` and rfsim server started on 4043.
- Start UE; observe successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, SSB detection, PRACH, RRC setup.
Further checks (nice-to-have):
- Keep TAC consistent across CU/DU if both sides validate it in SIB/NG setup; align `plmn_list` across CU/DU/UE.
- Ensure AMF IPs are reachable and NGAP completes after F1.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated (no timestamps), but contain decisive validation failure on CU and repeated F1 connect refusals on DU; UE shows only rfsim connection failures. That is sufficient to attribute the cascade to CU TAC misconfiguration.
- The provided `cu_conf` JSON snapshot omits `tracking_area_code`, but the CU runtime log proves the actual file used contained an invalid TAC string; fix should be applied to the live CU config referenced by `-O`.
- PRACH/PHY settings look coherent; they did not execute due to earlier control-plane gating (F1 not up). No additional PHY root-cause analysis needed once CU boots cleanly.
