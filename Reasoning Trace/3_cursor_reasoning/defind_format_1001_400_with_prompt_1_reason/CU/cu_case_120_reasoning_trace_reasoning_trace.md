## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- OAI NR SA with RF simulator is used (CU/DU show SA mode; UE shows normal attach flow). The expected flow: DU init → F1 setup with CU → CU NGAP setup with AMF → DU activates radio and RFsim server → UE connects, performs RA, RRC, NAS registration, PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter: gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU="" (empty string) in CU config.
- Parsed network_config essentials:
  - cu_conf.gNBs.NG interfaces: GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF "192.168.8.43" (valid), GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU "" (invalid), GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U 2152.
  - cu_conf local_s_address 127.0.0.5, DU remote 127.0.0.3; AMF IPv4 192.168.70.132.
  - du_conf radio parameters and PRACH config are consistent with logs (n78, µ=1, N_RB 106).
- Initial mismatch signaled in CU logs: GTP-U address configured as empty string, leading to socket creation failure. This affects user plane (NG-U/N3) only; control plane (NG-C/F1-C) proceeds until PDU session setup.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU brings up NGAP and sends NGSetupRequest; receives NGSetupResponse from AMF → NG-C OK.
- GTPU block shows:
  - Configuring GTPu address : , port : 2152 (empty IP)
  - Initializing UDP for local address  with port 2152
  - getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known → can't create GTP-U instance → instance id -1
  - E1AP: Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener (no NG-U endpoint)
- Despite that, F1AP starts, DU connects, F1 Setup Response is sent; RRC proceeds: UE context creation, RRC Setup, SecurityMode, UE Capability, NGAP InitialContextSetup flows.
- At PDU session setup:
  - GTPU: try to get a gtp-u not existing output → assertion in cucp_cuup_handler.c:198 e1_bearer_context_setup() → Unable to create GTP Tunnel for NG-U → CU exits.
- Conclusion: CU CP is fine; UP fails due to missing NG-U bind IP.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU shows normal MAC/PHY stats for UE RNTI 33ba; CBRA succeeded, DL/UL HARQ running, BLER low → radio healthy.
- Later SCTP issues appear (connect refused / shutdown) after CU aborts due to the assertion; this is a consequence, not the cause.
- No PRACH/PHY misconfig seen; DU is fine until CU crashes.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE completes RRC security with nea2/nia2, receives Registration Accept, sends RegistrationComplete, sends PduSessionEstablishRequest.
- MAC stats normal; no indication of RFsim connectivity issues. UE is blocked later by network-side PDU session failure due to missing NG-U on CU.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - NGAP CP succeeds (NGSetup OK; RRC and NAS flows proceed) → control-plane OK.
  - When establishing the data bearer (PDU session), CU needs NG-U/N3 GTP-U sockets. Because GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU is empty, CU fails to create GTP-U instance and CU-UP N3 listener.
  - Attempting to continue triggers "gtp-u not existing output" and assertion at e1_bearer_context_setup → CU aborts; DU reports SCTP disruptions afterwards.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): Empty NG-U bind IP at cu_conf.gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU → GTP-U socket bind fails (getaddrinfo), CU-UP cannot be created, bearer setup asserts.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Config fix:
- Set a valid local NG-U IPv4 address for the CU bind. Typically, use the same IP as NGAMF interface if on single NIC, e.g., 192.168.8.43, or another reachable local IP dedicated to user plane. Ensure UDP/2152 is free.
- Optionally verify routing so that N3 (to UPF) is reachable from this address.

Corrected snippets (within network_config), with comments:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",
          // Fixed: set NG-U bind IP to a valid local address
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        }
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      // No change needed for DU
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change needed for UE
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks:
- Restart CU; confirm GTPU logs: Initializing UDP for local address 192.168.8.43 port 2152 and no errors. Check E1AP CUUP N3 listener success.
- Ensure PDU session setup proceeds without assertion; verify GTP-U tunnel creation to UPF succeeds (NGAP InitialContextSetup and PDU Session Resource Setup Complete at CU, and OAI UPF logs receive N3).
- If still failing, verify firewall rules allow UDP/2152, and that UPF N3 IP is reachable from CU bind IP; confirm no IP mismatch between CU and UPF.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are partially truncated and without timestamps; sequence inferred by message order.
- The exact UPF configuration is not provided; we assume a standard OAI CN where UPF listens on N3 and expects CU to bind on a reachable local IP.
- The conclusion is strongly supported by explicit CU errors (empty address in GTPU config, getaddrinfo failure, CUUP listener failure, assertion on bearer setup).
