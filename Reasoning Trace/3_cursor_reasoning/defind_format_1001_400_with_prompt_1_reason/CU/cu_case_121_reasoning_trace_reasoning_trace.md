## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The run is OAI NR SA with rfsim: CU and DU are split via F1, and a UE connects over the RF simulator. Expected bring-up: processes start → NGAP to AMF on CU → F1AP association CU↔DU → DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim → SSB detection/PRACH → RRC → PDU session.

Guiding misconfiguration: misconfigured_param = "gNBs.local_s_address=" (empty) in CU. In OAI F1 split, CU must bind its F1-U/NG-U local socket address for GTP-U; an empty address triggers name resolution failure and aborts CU networking threads.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- CU `gNBs`:
  - `local_s_if_name`: "lo"
  - `local_s_address`: ""  ← empty
  - `remote_s_address`: "127.0.0.3" (DU side)
  - `local_s_portc`: 501, `local_s_portd`: 2152
  - `amf_ip_address.ipv4`: "192.168.70.132"
  - `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/NGU`: "192.168.8.43"
- DU `gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0]`: TDD n78, 106 PRBs, PRACH config looks sane (`prach_ConfigurationIndex`: 98). DU networking:
  - F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5; bind GTP to 127.0.0.3
  - rfsimulator: `serveraddr`: "server" (DU should host the server), `serverport`: 4043
- UE: IMSI, keys present; RF tuned to 3619.2 MHz, SCS µ=1, 106 PRBs.

Immediate mismatch vs logs/misconfigured_param:
- CU log shows GTP-U init with empty local address, then `getaddrinfo` failure and abort. This directly matches the empty `local_s_address` misconfiguration and explains the cascade (no F1-U listener, F1-C fails later via assert, DU cannot connect; UE cannot reach rfsim server because DU delays activation until F1 Setup completes).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode and init:
  - SA mode enabled; NGAP threads start; GTP-U configured with NGU IP 192.168.8.43, port 2152 for AMF path, and general setup proceeds.
  - NGSetup with AMF succeeds (CU ↔ AMF OK), so NGCP plane fine.
- Failure point:
  - "GTPU Initializing UDP for local address  with port 2152" → address string is empty.
  - `getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known` → socket bind fails; `can't create GTP-U instance`.
  - Assertion in `sctp_create_new_listener()` and later `F1AP_CU_task(): Assertion (getCxt(instance)->gtpInst > 0) failed!` → CU aborts F1 tasks because F1-U (GTP-U) listener was not created.
- Cross-reference to CU config:
  - `gNBs.local_s_address` is empty. OAI uses this to bind local F1-U/NG-U; with empty string, name resolution fails.
  - DU expects CU F1-C at 127.0.0.5 (per DU log), but CU has no explicit `local_s_address` and therefore never brings up the listener.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- PHY/MAC init looks normal for TDD n78, µ=1, 106 PRBs; PRACH, TDD pattern, antenna ports configured; no PHY asserts.
- Networking:
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 127.0.0.3" → DU is client for F1-C to CU at 127.0.0.5 and binds its F1-U/NG-U local to 127.0.0.3.
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and retries for F1-C association.
  - DU waits: "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" → blocks rfsim server bring-up or radio activation gating.
- Conclusion: DU is healthy but cannot establish F1-C because CU aborted due to GTP-U local binding failure; therefore DU never activates radio/rfsim server.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE RF init matches DU config (3619.2 MHz, µ=1, 106 PRBs, TDD).
- UE is rfsim client attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly with errno 111 (connection refused).
- Since DU did not complete F1 Setup, it did not activate radio or rfsim server; the UE cannot connect to a non-listening server.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU: empty `local_s_address` → GTP-U bind fails → F1AP CU task asserts and exits.
  - DU: F1-C connect to CU 127.0.0.5 refused repeatedly → no F1 Setup Response → radio not activated → rfsim server not listening.
  - UE: rfsim TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 refused repeatedly.
- Root cause tied to misconfigured_param: Empty `gNBs.local_s_address` in CU. OAI requires a concrete IP string for local socket binding (e.g., loopback `127.0.0.5` if using separate loopback IPs for CU/DU). The empty value propagates to `getaddrinfo`, causing failure and subsequent asserts in CU networking and F1 tasks.
- Sanity of other parameters:
  - DU PRACH/TDD/SSB params are consistent and show no crash.
  - DU expects CU at 127.0.0.5; CU should use that as its local address where appropriate and keep DU remote address as 127.0.0.3.
  - NGAP to AMF works with `192.168.8.43`; unrelated to the F1/GTP failure.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix (mandatory): set CU `gNBs.local_s_address` to the intended CU loopback IP (127.0.0.5) to match DU expectations; ensure consistency across F1-C/F1-U.

Optional alignments:
- Confirm CU `remote_s_address` remains DU IP 127.0.0.3 (already set).
- Ensure DU MACRLC/F1 addresses match: DU `local_n_address` 127.0.0.3, `remote_n_address` 127.0.0.5 (already consistent with logs).
- Keep NGU/NGAP addresses as configured if reachable; they are independent of F1.

Proposed corrected snippets (within `network_config`):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "local_s_if_name": "lo",
      "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5", // FIX: was empty; CU binds F1-U/NG-U here
      "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3", // DU side, unchanged
      "local_s_portc": 501,
      "local_s_portd": 2152,
      "remote_s_portc": 500,
      "remote_s_portd": 2152
    }
  }
}
```

DU configuration is already coherent with this topology; no change required for addresses. If you prefer to make the intent explicit for rfsim server, keep:

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "server", // DU hosts server; UE connects to 127.0.0.1
      "serverport": 4043
    }
  }
}
```

Operational validation steps after fixing CU:
- Start CU → verify no `getaddrinfo` errors; confirm `F1AP at CU` starts and no asserts.
- Start DU → observe SCTP F1-C association success and receipt of `F1 Setup Response`; DU logs should progress to activating radio and starting rfsim server.
- Start UE → rfsim TCP connect succeeds; observe SSB detection and RA (PRACH) attempts.

Further debugging if issues persist:
- If F1-C still refuses, verify loopback alias `127.0.0.5` exists and is reachable on the host (Linux: `ip addr add 127.0.0.5/8 dev lo`).
- If NGU conflicts arise, ensure CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU` is consistent with host routing.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated around the crash; no timestamps, but sequencing is clear from messages.
- JSON configs are partial; we assumed standard OAI behavior that DU defers radio activation until F1 Setup completes, which explains UE rfsim connection failures.
- Root cause rests on OAI socket binding requirements: an empty `local_s_address` is invalid and leads to `getaddrinfo` failure, matching the CU log.
