## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- **Scenario**: OAI NR SA with rfsim. CU runs with --rfsim --sa; DU initializes NR PHY/MAC and F1; UE is an rfsim client. The CU proceeds through NG setup and then starts F1. The misconfigured parameter is gNBs.local_s_portd=invalid_string (CU side), which governs the CU? local F1-U (GTP-U) UDP listener port.
- **Expected flow**: (1) CU loads config ??NGSetup with AMF succeeds ??CU starts F1-C and F1-U (UDP) listeners; (2) DU connects via F1-C, receives F1 Setup Response, then activates radio (rfsim server) and F1-U tunnel; (3) UE connects to the rfsim server, detects SSB, performs PRACH/RA, RRC attach, PDU session.
- **What goes wrong (high level)**: CU attempts to create the F1-U UDP listener but fails to bind due to a bad/misparsed port (derived from local_s_portd=invalid_string) leading to an ?ddress already in use??and an assertion in 1ap_cu_task.c; CU then exits. DU keeps retrying F1-C SCTP (connection refused/never completes), and UE cannot connect to rfsim server since the DU never activates radio.
- **Network_config parsing**:
  - 
etwork_config.cu_conf.gNBs: shows F1 addresses (local_s_address: 127.0.0.5, 
emote_s_address: 127.0.0.3), local_s_portc: 501, but no explicit local_s_portd in this JSON. The logs show CU tries to initialize a GTP-U socket on 127.0.0.5:50001 (F1-U). Given the misconfigured param, OAI likely parsed the invalid string into a fallback/undefined value resulting in port 50001, which then collides with another socket on the host.
  - 
etwork_config.du_conf: DU uses local_n_address: 127.0.0.3, 
emote_n_address: 127.0.0.5, local_n_portc: 500, local_n_portd: 2152, 
emote_n_portc: 501, 
emote_n_portd: 2152 (DU expects CU F1-U on port 2152). PRACH/SSB/TDD parameters are consistent with logs. DU TAC=1 matches CU TAC=1.
  - 
etwork_config.ue_conf: SIM credentials only; rfsim defaults visible in UE logs (127.0.0.1:4043).
- **Initial mismatch**: DU expects CU F1-U at port 2152 (remote_n_portd), while CU (due to misconfigured local_s_portd) attempts to use 50001 and fails to bind. Even without the mismatch, the bind failure terminates CU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU initialization OK: SA mode; NGAP threads created; NGSetup works: ?end NGSetupRequest to AMF??followed by ?eceived NGSetupResponse from AMF?? GTP-U for NG-U is configured: GTPu address : 192.168.8.43, port : 2152 and initialized fine.
- F1 start: F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5. Immediately afterwards:
  - Initializing UDP for local address 127.0.0.5 with port 50001
  - ind: Address already in use
  - ailed to bind socket: 127.0.0.5 50001
  - can't create GTP-U instance
  - Assertion fails in F1AP_CU_task() (line 126): ?ailed to create CU F1-U UDP listener????CU exits.
- Cross-reference to config: local_s_portd should be numeric and aligned with DU? 
emote_n_portd. Misconfigured as a string, it is misparsed (or defaulted) to 50001, which on this host is already in use, leading to bind failure and CU abort.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- PHY/MAC init is nominal; TDD and carrier settings match config. DU prints TAC=1, MCC/MNC match.
- F1 behavior: DU starts F1AP, sets up GTPU on 127.0.0.3:2152 and repeatedly attempts SCTP to the CU 127.0.0.5. Because the CU aborts during F1-U setup, the DU never receives F1 Setup Response and logs: ?aiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio?? with continuous SCTP retries (connection refused/never completes handshakes to a functioning CU task).
- Implication: DU cannot activate radio ??no rfsim server started.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE RF/numerology match the DU (NRB 106, 3.6192 GHz). UE runs as rfsim client and repeatedly attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- All attempts fail with errno(111) because the rfsim server is not running on the DU (it waits for F1 Setup Response, which never arrives due to CU abort).

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU succeeds NG, then fails on F1-U listener creation due to local_s_portd misconfiguration ??bind error on 127.0.0.5:50001 ??assertion ??CU exits.
  - DU waits for F1 Setup Response and does not activate radio/rfsim server.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim (connection refused) and stalls.
- Root cause: **gNBs.local_s_portd=invalid_string (CU)**. OAI expects a numeric UDP port for F1-U; the invalid string leads to an unexpected/incorrect port selection (50001) and a bind conflict, then CU exits by assertion in F1 CU task.
- Secondary mismatch: DU expects CU F1-U on port 2152 (
emote_n_portd: 2152) while CU tried port 50001. Even without the port collision, this mismatch would prevent F1-U tunnel establishment. Primary blocker remains CU abort on bind.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix the CU config:
  - Set local_s_portd to a valid, unused numeric port. To align with DU expectations, set it to 2152 (as DU? 
emote_n_portd is 2152). Since CU? NG-U also uses 2152 but bound on 192.168.8.43, binding CU F1-U on 127.0.0.5:2152 is acceptable due to different local IPs.
  - Ensure no other process is bound to the chosen port/IP (kill leftover softmodems if any).
  - Alternatively, choose another dedicated F1-U port (e.g., 50000) and update DU 
emote_n_portd to the same value for consistency.

- Corrected JSON snippets within 
etwork_config (comments explain changes):

`json
{
   network_config: {
    cu_conf: {
      gNBs: {
        local_s_portd: 2152,
        local_s_portc: 501,
        local_s_address: 127.0.0.5,
        remote_s_address: 127.0.0.3
      }
    },
    du_conf: {
      MACRLCs: [
        {
          remote_n_portd: 2152
        }
      ]
    },
    ue_conf: {
    }
  }
}
`

- Validation steps after the fix:
  - Start CU and confirm no ind: Address already in use for F1-U; CU should keep running after NG setup.
  - Start DU and confirm F1 Setup Response is received and DU logs ctivating radio (rfsim server starts).
  - Start UE and confirm successful TCP connection to 127.0.0.1:4043, SSB sync, RA, RRC attach.

- Additional checks:
  - Ensure CU and DU F1 addresses and ports are symmetric: CU local_s_* ??DU 
emote_n_*, DU local_n_* ??CU 
emote_s_*.
  - Keep PLMN and TAC consistent (already aligned at 1/1/2 and TAC=1 in both configs).

## 7. Limitations

- Logs lack explicit print of CU? local_s_portd value from the config file; we infer from the misconfigured parameter and from the CU attempting to bind on 50001 that the invalid string led to an incorrect port selection and collision. The DU? port expectations (2152) and the CU assertion confirm the failure point is F1-U UDP listener creation at the CU.
