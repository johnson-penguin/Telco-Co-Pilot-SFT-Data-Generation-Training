## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The logs show OAI NR SA with RF Simulator: CU/DU in SA mode; DU configured to host rfsimulator on port 4043; UE repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU initializes and exposes F1-C (SCTP) → DU connects and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio and starts rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim → SSB sync → PRACH/RACH → RRC → NAS.
- Misconfigured parameter: `security.integrity_algorithms[1]=nia9` in CU. OAI supports only NIA0/NIA1/NIA2/NIA3. `nia9` is invalid and rejected by RRC/security configuration.
- Parsed configuration highlights:
  - CU `gNBs`: F1 server at `127.0.0.5` (ports c=501/d=2152) towards DU `127.0.0.3`. AMF IP `192.168.70.132` (not exercised here). Security lists: `integrity_algorithms=["nia2","nia9"]` (invalid second entry), `ciphering_algorithms=["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"]` (valid).
  - DU `gNBs[0]`: F1 client to CU (`remote_n_address=127.0.0.5`), servingCellConfigCommon consistent with n78, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs, PRACH index 98, coherent TDD pattern; rfsimulator server: port 4043.
  - UE: USIM present; UE operates as rfsim client to `127.0.0.1:4043` per logs.
- Initial mismatch: CU logs contain `[RRC] unknown integrity algorithm "nia9"`, matching the misconfigured parameter; this likely halts CU before it opens F1-C for DU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA, prints build and identifiers.
- Critical error: `[RRC]   unknown integrity algorithm "nia9" in section "security" of the configuration file`.
- Config parsing messages follow, but there are no F1AP listener or NGAP/AMF connection lines afterwards → indicates CU did not reach operational state due to the bad integrity algorithm entry.
- Cross-check with config: `integrity_algorithms` includes `nia9` at index 1; accepted tokens are `nia0`, `nia1`, `nia2`, `nia3`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- PHY/MAC initialization is normal: antenna settings, TDD pattern, 3.6192 GHz, N_RB 106, SIB1; no PHY asserts.
- F1AP: DU attempts SCTP to CU at `127.0.0.5` and gets repeated `Connect failed: Connection refused`; F1AP retries accordingly.
- DU remains: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → radio and rfsim server are not started.
- Conclusion: The orchestration is blocked by F1-C refusal from CU (consistent with CU not listening after failing on integrity algorithm parsing).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY coherent with DU cell parameters.
- UE repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` connection refused.
- Since DU is waiting for F1 Setup and has not started rfsim server, UE connection attempts fail; these are downstream effects of the CU misconfiguration.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence correlation:
  - CU rejects unsupported `nia9` integrity algorithm → CU RRC/security init halts → F1-C not opened.
  - DU’s SCTP to CU is refused repeatedly → DU waits for F1 Setup, keeps radio inactive.
  - DU never starts rfsim server → UE’s TCP connection attempts to 4043 are refused.
- Root cause: invalid integrity algorithm token `nia9` in CU `security.integrity_algorithms`. OAI accepts only `nia0/1/2/3`. The CU log explicitly confirms the parsing error.
- Standards/implementation context:
  - 3GPP TS 33.501 specifies integrity algorithms; typical OAI support: NIA0, NIA1, NIA2, NIA3. No `nia9` exists.
  - OAI configuration parser validates tokens; unknown tokens cause RRC/security config errors and prevent full startup.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix: replace the unsupported `nia9` with a supported algorithm (e.g., `nia1` or `nia0`). A recommended preference ordering is `["nia2","nia1","nia0","nia3"]`.
- Expected recovery after fix: CU fully initializes and opens F1-C → DU completes F1 Setup and activates radio → rfsim server starts on 4043 → UE connects to rfsim and proceeds with RACH/RRC/NAS.
- Verification steps:
  - CU: confirm absence of the "unknown integrity algorithm" error; observe F1AP listener and NGAP attempts.
  - DU: observe successful SCTP association and F1 Setup; radio activation; rfsim server listening.
  - UE: observe successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043; SSB detection; RACH and RRC connection.
- Corrected configuration snippets (focused on the issue):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": [
          "nea3",
          "nea2",
          "nea1",
          "nea0"
        ],
        "integrity_algorithms": [
          "nia2",
          "nia1"  
        ],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {},
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
}
```

- Hardening:
  - Validate security algorithm lists against supported tokens pre-deployment.
  - Ensure SCTP ports (500/501) are open locally; while not the cause here, this avoids confounding issues post-fix.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; sequence inferred from typical OAI behavior and component dependencies.
- AMF/NGAP not exercised due to earlier failure; after fixing integrity algorithms, verify AMF reachability.
- If issues persist, inspect F1 port bindings, firewall/SELinux, and rfsim server binding on DU.
