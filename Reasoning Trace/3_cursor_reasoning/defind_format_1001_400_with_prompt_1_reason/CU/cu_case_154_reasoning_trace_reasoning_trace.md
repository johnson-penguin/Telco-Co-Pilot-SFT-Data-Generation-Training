## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR Standalone with RFsim (flags show "--rfsim --sa"). Expected startup: CU and DU initialize → F1-C association (SCTP) between DU (127.0.0.3) and CU (127.0.0.5) → DU activates radio and starts RFsim server on 4043 → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB detect → RACH/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.

Network configuration parsing highlights a critical mismatch in the CU `gnb_conf`: `gNBs.plmn_list.mnc=9999999` with `mnc_length=2`. The DU’s PLMN is MCC=1, MNC=1, length=2; the UE IMSI is `001010000000001` (MCC 001, MNC 01) which aligns to MCC=1, MNC=1, length=2. Thus, the CU’s MNC is invalid both by range and by mismatch.

Initial issues to look for given the misconfigured_param:
- Invalid PLMN values cause OAI config validation to fail early in CU, leading to CU process exit.
- With CU down, DU cannot complete F1 setup (SCTP connect refused), so radio activation is blocked and RFsim server does not come up.
- Without RFsim server, UE repeatedly fails to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode, version info, and F1AP CU identity initialization.
- Crucial line: `config_check_intrange: mnc: 9999999 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999` followed by `config_execcheck ... wrong value` and an immediate exit via `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- No NGAP or AMF connection attempts appear; the CU dies before networking initialization.

Cross-reference with config:
- CU `plmn_list` shows `mnc: 9999999` and `mnc_length: 2`. Valid MNC must be 0..999 and must conform to the declared length. This is a hard validation failure exactly matching the CU error.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU correctly, parses SIB1/TDD and frequencies (SSB 641280 → 3619.2 MHz, N_RB 106, μ=1), prints antenna ports and timers.
- F1AP attempts: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`. All SCTP connections fail with `Connection refused` and it keeps retrying.
- DU prints `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`, indicating radio activation (and RFsim server bring-up) is gated on successful F1 setup with CU.
- There are no PRACH/PHY fatal errors; the DU is simply blocked due to missing CU.

Link to config:
- DU PLMN is valid (MCC=1, MNC=1, length=2) and matches UE.
- F1 addresses match CU/DU IPs from config (`127.0.0.5` CU, `127.0.0.3` DU). Failures are because CU is not running (exited on config error).


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with DL/UL frequency 3619.2 MHz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106 consistent with DU.
- UE acts as RFsim client and repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` but receives `errno(111) connection refused`.
- This strongly implies the RFsim server is not listening. In OAI SA+rfsim flows, the DU hosts the RFsim server and only starts it after CU–DU F1 setup completes. Because CU is down, DU does not reach the radio activation step; thus no RFsim server, causing UE connection failures.

Link to config:
- UE SIM/PLMN (IMSI 00101...) is aligned with MCC=001/MNC=01 (i.e., 1/1 length 2). No UE-side PLMN issue.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Root cause is explicitly flagged in CU logs and matches `misconfigured_param`: `gNBs.plmn_list.mnc=9999999` (with `mnc_length=2`). Valid MNC must be in [0,999] and match its encoded length (2 or 3 digits). `9999999` is out of range and length-inconsistent, causing CU’s config validator to abort immediately.
- Cascade:
  - CU exits → DU’s F1 SCTP connection to CU fails (connection refused) → DU stays in pre-activation state → RFsim server never starts → UE cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and loops with connection refused.
- Therefore, all DU/UE symptoms derive from the CU’s invalid PLMN configuration.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix (CU): Correct the PLMN to match DU/UE and to satisfy range/length checks.
- Set `mnc` to `1` (or `01`) and keep `mnc_length=2` to match DU and UE.
- Ensure MCC=1, MNC=1 are consistently used across CU/DU/UE.

After change, expected behavior:
- CU passes config validation, proceeds to NGAP/F1 init.
- DU’s F1 connect succeeds; DU activates radio and starts RFsim server.
- UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043, detects SSB, performs PRACH, and continues attach.

Corrected `network_config` snippets (JSON with comments for clarity):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "plmn_list": {
        "mcc": 1,
        "mnc": 1,               // FIX: was 9999999 (invalid). Set to 1 to match DU/UE
        "mnc_length": 2,         // Keep 2, consistent with MNC=01 format
        "snssaiList": { "sst": 1 }
      }
      // other fields unchanged
    }
  },
  "du_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "plmn_list": [
          { "mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2, "snssaiList": [ { "sst": 1, "sd": "0x010203" } ] }
        ]
        // unchanged; already correct and aligned with UE
      }
    ]
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "uicc0": {
      "imsi": "001010000000001"  // MCC=001, MNC=01 -> matches MCC=1, MNC=1, length=2
    }
  }
}
```

Optional validations after applying the fix:
- Start CU first and verify no `[CONFIG] ... wrong value` errors.
- Confirm DU F1AP connects and prints that radio is activated; look for RFsim server listening on 4043.
- Verify UE successfully connects to RFsim server and proceeds beyond connection attempts.

Further checks (if any residual issues):
- Ensure CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` IPs are reachable for NGAP if AMF is used. For pure rfsim demos, these often don’t block RFsim bring-up.
- Confirm `mnc_length` matches the intended encoding (2 for `01`, 3 for `001`).


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; however, the CU’s explicit config validation error conclusively identifies the root cause.
- No need for 3GPP spec lookup here since the failure is from OAI’s configuration validator. If needed, PLMN encoding constraints align with 3GPP PLMN rules and OAI’s accepted MNC range [0..999] with declared 2- or 3-digit length.
