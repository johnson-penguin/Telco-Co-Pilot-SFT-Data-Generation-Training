## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The setup runs OAI 5G NR in SA mode with RFsim (logs: "running in SA mode"). Expected flow: CU initializes and connects NGAP to AMF → DU starts and establishes F1-C to CU → DU activates radio (RFsim server) → UE connects to RFsim server, performs PRACH and RRC → PDU session.
- The provided misconfiguration is explicit: gNBs.tr_s_preference=invalid_preference in CU `gnb.conf`. This field selects the CU side’s split/transport preference that drives whether F1 server/threads initialize correctly. An invalid value can short-circuit CU F1 initialization, leaving DU’s F1 connection refused and the RFsim server never advertised/usable.
- Network config highlights:
  - CU `gNBs`:
    - `gNB_ID` 0xe00, `gNB_name` gNB-Eurecom-CU, `tr_s_preference` invalid_preference, NG interfaces set to 192.168.8.43; AMF IP 192.168.70.132. Local/remote F1 endpoints: CU at 127.0.0.5, DU at 127.0.0.3, SCTP ports 500/501.
  - DU `gNBs[0]` + `MACRLCs[0]`:
    - F1 addressing: DU local 127.0.0.3, CU remote 127.0.0.5, ports match CU.
    - `servingCellConfigCommon[0]` indicates n78, μ=1, BW 106 PRBs, SSB 641280 (3.6192 GHz), PRACH index 98, TDD pattern present.
    - `MACRLCs[0].tr_s_preference` is valid: local_L1 (DU MAC↔L1 collocated), `tr_n_preference` f1 (MAC↔CU over F1).
  - UE: IMSI/security populated; RF connection controlled by RFsim client trying to connect to server 127.0.0.1:4043.

Initial mismatch noted: CU `tr_s_preference` is invalid, while DU uses valid values and attempts F1 setup toward CU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU initializes normally, creates NGAP/RRC/GTPTU threads, and completes NGSetup with AMF:
  - "Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 192.168.8.43"
  - "Send NGSetupRequest" → "Received NGSetupResponse"
- No CU-side F1AP listener/server messages are present; we do not see CU handling an incoming F1 association nor advertising F1 server readiness.
- Given CU shows healthy NGAP but no F1 acceptance, the DU’s SCTP failures (below) imply CU’s F1-C server was not started. That aligns with `tr_s_preference` being invalid at CU, preventing proper intra-CU split initialization/F1 stack bring-up.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU PHY/MAC init is healthy: n78 parameters parsed, TDD config applied, BW 106PRB, μ=1, SSB at 3.6192 GHz; antenna/RU threads created. No PRACH/PHY assertions or crashes.
- F1 path repeatedly fails on SCTP connect to CU 127.0.0.5:
  - "SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused" followed by retries and "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio".
- Because CU is not accepting SCTP on F1-C, DU cannot complete F1 Setup → DU never "activates radio" (RFsim server remains unavailable from the network perspective).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE RFsim client repeatedly attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and receives errno(111) (connection refused). This indicates the RFsim server side (provided by DU when radio activates) is not listening.
- Since DU is blocked waiting for F1 Setup Response, the RFsim server side is not active, hence UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU: NGAP is up; no F1 accept observed.
  - DU: F1-C to CU is refused repeatedly → DU stalls before radio activation.
  - UE: RFsim client connection refused → cannot progress to PRACH/RRC.
- Guided by the known misconfiguration: CU `gNBs.tr_s_preference=invalid_preference`.
  - In OAI, `tr_s_preference` drives how split components are wired (e.g., MAC↔L1 local, MAC↔CU over F1). Invalid value prevents initializing the CU’s F1 server/threads, so SCTP on F1-C is not opened. This directly explains DU’s repeated SCTP connection refusals and UE’s inability to reach a running RFsim server.
- Therefore, the root cause is the invalid CU `tr_s_preference`, which blocks CU F1 bring-up → DU cannot complete F1 Setup → DU does not start radio/RFsim server → UE connection attempts to 4043 fail.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Correct CU `tr_s_preference` to a valid value used by OAI for CU side. For this SA CU/DU split with F1, use a valid transport/split option. Typical valid values in OAI configs include "local_mac" for local MAC↔L1 and "f1" for network transport. For CU, set the server side consistent with DU using F1.

- After change: restart CU first (ensures F1 server listening) → start DU (F1 Setup completes, DU activates radio and RFsim server) → start UE (RFsim client connects, then PRACH/RRC proceeds).

- Additional checks:
  - Ensure CU `local_s_address` 127.0.0.5 and DU `remote_n_address` 127.0.0.5 match; ports 500/501 align.
  - Keep DU `MACRLCs[0].tr_s_preference=local_L1` and `tr_n_preference=f1` unchanged (they are correct).
  - Leave PHY cell params (SSB, PRACH index 98, μ=1, BW 106) as-is since no PHY assertions are seen.

Operational validation steps:
- After the fix, expect CU logs to show F1AP server ready and DU logs to show successful SCTP association and F1 Setup Response; DU should log "activating radio". UE should then connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 without errno(111), proceed with PRACH (Msg1/Msg2), and RRC.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; correlation is based on message ordering and typical OAI behavior.
- We did not observe explicit CU F1 server errors; diagnosis relies on the known invalid parameter and DU SCTP refusal pattern.
- Spec references: behavior aligns with OAI split design and standard SA attach sequence; no PRACH spec issues suspected here as DU PHY is stable and failure occurs before RA.
