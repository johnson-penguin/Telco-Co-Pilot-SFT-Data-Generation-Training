## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI NR SA with rfsimulator, as shown by the softmodem command lines and log lines indicating "--rfsim" and "SA mode". Expected bring-up flow: process start → CU initializes (E1/NGAP/GTP-U) → DU initializes (F1, PHY/MAC, TDD) → F1 Setup between DU and CU → CU connects to AMF via NGAP → UE connects to rfsim server, acquires SSB, performs PRACH/RA → RRC setup and, ultimately, PDU session establishment.

The misconfigured parameter is explicitly provided as gNBs.gNB_name= (empty) for the CU. In OAI, `Active_gNBs` names drive which `gNBs` object is bound and how configuration is populated across subsystems (RRC, F1/E1, NGAP). An empty `gNB_name` often causes downstream config parsing anomalies: identity fields (PLMN) may default to zeros, and E1/F1 setup may reject due to mismatches.

Network config summary (relevant fields):
- CU `Active_gNBs`: ["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], but CU `gNBs.gNB_name` is "" (empty). PLMN is mcc=1, mnc=1, TAC=1, `gNB_ID`=0xe00, local/remote F1 addresses 127.0.0.5/127.0.0.3, NGU/NGAP address 192.168.8.43. This mismatch (empty name vs Active name) is a red flag.
- DU has consistent identity: `gNB_DU_ID`=0xe00, `gNB_name`="gNB-Eurecom-DU", PLMN mcc=1/mnc=1, serving cell common parameters set (DL 3619 MHz, FR1 n78, μ=1, N_RB=106), `prach_ConfigurationIndex`=98 (reasonable for μ=1). F1 endpoints are DU 127.0.0.3 ↔ CU 127.0.0.5.
- UE is standard OAI UE with IMSI 001010000000001. RF numerology/frequency matches DU (3619 MHz, μ=1).

Initial mismatch indicators guided by the misconfigured parameter:
- Empty CU `gNB_name` likely prevents proper binding of PLMN from CU config into RRC, resulting in 000/0 PLMN in RRC and E1/F1 failures.

No PRACH configuration issues are indicated; instead, control-plane identity mismatch dominates.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA, initializes NGAP/GTP-U, spawns tasks. GTP-U address uses 192.168.8.43:2152 consistent with `NETWORK_INTERFACES`.
- Critical anomaly: `[GNB_APP] F1AP: gNB_CU_name[0]` is blank, consistent with `gNBs.gNB_name=""`.
- RRC reports: `PLMNs received from CUUP (mcc:1, mnc:1) did not match with PLMNs in RRC (mcc:0, mnc:0)` and later `PLMN mismatch: CU 000.0, DU 00101`. This indicates CU RRC is running with default-zero PLMN while the rest of the system (CUUP/E1 side and DU) uses 001/01.
- F1 at CU starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU (id 3584), then rejects/shuts down the association due to PLMN mismatch, leading to `no DU connected` message.

Cross-reference to config:
- CU config advertises PLMN mcc=1/mnc=1, but RRC prints 0/0 → implies the CU RRC did not apply the PLMN from the loaded `gNBs` block. With an empty `gNB_name`, the name-based selection mechanism can fail, leaving RRC with empty/default values. This matches the misconfigured parameter.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC with consistent serving cell parameters, TDD pattern, band/frequency, and antenna config. No PHY/MAC asserts.
- F1: DU attempts to connect to CU at 127.0.0.5. DU later logs: `[MAC] the CU reported F1AP Setup Failure, is there a configuration mismatch?` This is the direct effect of the CU-side PLMN mismatch and identity configuration failure.
- Command line shows DU is a baseline run; PRACH settings (`prach_ConfigurationIndex`=98) are valid for μ=1. No RA-related errors are present because radios are not activated without a successful F1 Setup Response.

Link to config:
- DU and CU F1 endpoints match (DU 127.0.0.3 ↔ CU 127.0.0.5). The only blocker is the CU rejecting due to identity mismatch stemming from the empty `gNB_name` in CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for DL 3619 MHz, μ=1, N_RB=106—consistent with DU.
- UE acts as rfsim client, repeatedly failing to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 with errno 111 (connection refused). In OAI/rfsim, the DU is typically the server; it begins listening only after radio activation, which is gated on a successful F1 Setup. Because CU rejected F1, DU keeps F1 in failure and does not fully activate the radio/rfsim server, causing the UE's connection attempts to be refused.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU RRC uses PLMN 0/0 → E1 setup failure indication and later F1 setup failure due to PLMN mismatch with DU (001/01).
  - DU receives F1 Setup Failure → radio not activated → rfsim server not listening.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 → repeated ECONNREFUSED.
- The initiating fault is the CU `gNBs.gNB_name` configured as empty, which breaks the config binding path in OAI. With the `Active_gNBs` list containing `"gNB-Eurecom-CU"` but the actual `gNBs.gNB_name` empty, CU RRC falls back to defaults (PLMN 000/0). This directly produces the observed PLMN mismatches and F1 rejection.
- No evidence of PHY-level misconfiguration (e.g., PRACH) or NGAP transport issues; the failure is purely identity/config binding on the CU side.

Therefore, the root cause is: misconfigured CU `gNBs.gNB_name` (empty), causing CU RRC to operate with default identity (PLMN 000/0), which leads to E1/F1 setup failures and cascades to DU radio non-activation and UE rfsim connection refusal.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Set CU `gNBs.gNB_name` to match `Active_gNBs[0]` ("gNB-Eurecom-CU"). Ensure CU PLMN stays mcc=1/mnc=1 and that `gNB_ID`/`nr_cellid` are consistent. After this, CU should accept F1 Setup from DU; DU will activate radio; UE can connect to rfsim and proceed with RA/RRC.

Optional validation checks:
- Verify CU RRC logs show PLMN 001/01 post-fix.
- Confirm F1 Setup completes and DU log shows "activating radio" followed by rfsim server listening.
- Validate NGAP NGSetup with AMF completes (if AMF is present), but it's not required for UE PHY link in rfsim.

Operational steps after applying the fix:
- Restart CU, then DU, then UE. Observe CU RRC PLMN and F1 setup success before starting the UE.
- If UE still cannot connect to rfsim, check DU log for "waiting for F1 Setup Response"; ensure CU is reachable and F1 ports (500/501) are not blocked.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and omit timestamps; we infer sequencing from message order. Nonetheless, the CU PLMN 0/0 vs DU 001/01 mismatch and the empty `gNB_CU_name` conclusively indicate the config binding failure.
- We did not consult external specs, as the failure is configuration/identity binding rather than 38.211/38.331 parameter validity.
