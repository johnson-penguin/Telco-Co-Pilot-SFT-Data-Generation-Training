## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- SA mode with RFSIM: CU, DU, and UE logs show SA and rfsimulator usage. Expected bring-up: CU initializes and listens for F1-C, DU connects via F1-C to CU, DU activates radio/RFSIM server, UE connects to RFSIM 127.0.0.1:4043, PRACH/RA → RRC → NAS.
- Misconfigured parameter provided: security.integrity_algorithms[0]=0 (in CU config). CU logs confirm: unknown integrity algorithm "0" in section "security".
- Immediate risk: CU RRC/security config parsing failure prevents CU from becoming F1-C server; DU’s SCTP to CU fails; DU never activates radio; UE cannot connect to RFSIM server.
- Parse network_config highlights:
  - cu_conf.gNBs: tr_s_preference "f1" with CU at 127.0.0.5 and DU at 127.0.0.3; NG interfaces set; AMF IPv4 given. Security: ciphering_algorithms [nea3, nea2, nea1, nea0]; integrity_algorithms ["0", nia0]. The leading "0" is invalid; valid values are nia0, nia1, nia2, nia3.
  - du_conf: servingCellConfigCommon has 3.6192 GHz, N_RB 106, TDD settings, PRACH index 98 (valid for μ=1), RFSIM serverport 4043 and serveraddr "server" (DU acts as server).
  - ue_conf: IMSI/DNN OK; UE will connect to RFSIM server at 127.0.0.1:4043 by default.

Conclusion up front: The CU security integrity algorithm misconfiguration blocks CU startup, cascading into DU F1 connection failures and UE RFSIM connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- SA mode confirmed; CU initializes RAN context for CU-only (no MAC/L1/RU instances, as expected for split F1 CU).
- Key error:
  - [RRC] unknown integrity algorithm "0" in section "security" of the configuration file.
- After config path print and sections read, CU does not show F1AP server bind or NGAP towards AMF—consistent with early config error preventing full bring-up.
- Cross-reference cu_conf: security.integrity_algorithms begins with "0"; OAI expects strings: "nia0", "nia1", "nia2", or "nia3". A non-matching token yields an "unknown ... algorithm" error in the CU’s RRC config parsing, blocking security capability setup and further initialization.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU successfully, sets TDD config, frequencies 3619.2 MHz, N_RB 106, prints SIB1 and TDD details.
- F1AP start at DU, then:
  - F1-C DU IP 127.0.0.3 connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5.
  - Repeated SCTP connect failed: Connection refused → F1 association unsuccessful, retrying.
  - DU prints waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
- Interpretation: CU is not listening on 127.0.0.5:500/501 because it aborted on config error; DU cannot complete F1 setup; DU holds radio activation (and hence RFSIM server) until F1 Setup completes.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY at same frequency/bandwidth; then repeatedly:
  - Running as client; will connect to rfsimulator server side.
  - Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 → connect() failed, errno(111) repeating.
- Interpretation: The RFSIM server is not up. In OAI, the DU acts as server for RFSIM and starts after radio activation. Since DU is blocked waiting for F1 Setup (CU down), the server never starts; UE connection attempts fail.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline linkage:
  - CU hits config parse error at security.integrity_algorithms → CU does not start F1-C listener.
  - DU attempts SCTP to CU at 127.0.0.5, repeatedly refused → no F1 Setup → DU does not activate radio nor RFSIM server.
  - UE cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 (connection refused), because DU never started the server.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): Invalid integrity algorithm token "0" in CU config. Valid values are nia0/nia1/nia2/nia3. The invalid first entry causes CU RRC/security configuration to fail early.
- No evidence of PHY/PRACH/SIB mismatches causing crashes; DU PHY initialized fine. Failures are strictly control-plane setup blocked by CU config error.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix CU integrity algorithm list to valid entries and order by preference. Common choices: ["nia2", "nia1", "nia0"] or include "nia3" if supported end-to-end.
- After fix, expected recovery path: CU starts (F1-C listening) → DU completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio & RFSIM server → UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043 → PRACH/RA and RRC proceed.
- Optional verifications:
  - Ensure CU logs show F1AP listening and NGAP to AMF.
  - DU logs show F1 Setup Complete and radio activation prior to RFSIM server accepting connections.
  - UE shows successful RFSIM connect and synchronization.

    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "integrity_algorithms": [
          "nia2",   // changed from invalid "0" to valid algorithm, preferred first
          "nia1",
          "nia0"
        ],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",

    },
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server", // unchanged; DU acts as RFSIM server
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "uicc0": { "imsi": "001010000000001", "dnn": "oai" } // unchanged
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Apply the CU config fix, restart CU, then DU, then UE. Confirm F1 and RFSIM bring-up before UE start if needed.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; we infer ordering from typical OAI behavior and message sequences.
- We did not need external specs for this specific error, as OAI log explicitly flags the invalid integrity token and the cascading failures align with expected F1/RFSIM dependencies.
