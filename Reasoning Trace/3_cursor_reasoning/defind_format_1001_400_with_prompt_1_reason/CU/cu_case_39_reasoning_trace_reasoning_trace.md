## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The deployment is OAI 5G NR in SA mode using the RF simulator. CU logs show the binary invoked with `--rfsim --sa`, and DU/UE logs reflect typical SA initialization. The expected bring-up flow is: component init → F1AP association (DU↔CU) and NGAP (CU↔AMF) → radio activation → UE PRACH/RACH → RRC connection → PDU session.

Network configuration summary from `network_config`:
- CU `plmn_list.snssaiList.sst` is 9,999,999, explicitly flagged in CU logs as invalid: authorized range is 0–255. Misconfigured parameter provided also points to this field.
- DU `snssaiList.sst` is 1 with `sd=0x010203` (valid). UE `nssai_sst` is 1 (aligns with DU).
- F1 addressing is consistent: CU `local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, DU `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5`; DU `local_n_address=127.0.0.3`, CU `remote_s_address=127.0.0.3`.
- RF numerology matches across DU and UE (band n78, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB=106, DL 3619.2 MHz).

Initial hypothesis from the misconfiguration: an out-of-range SST at the CU causes early configuration validation failure, preventing CU startup. This blocks F1AP establishment (DU↔CU) and explains UE’s inability to connect to the RF simulator server (no gNB stack fully running on the server side).

Potential issue vectors to watch in logs: config validation/exit at CU, F1AP connect-refused at DU, and repeated rfsim connect attempts at UE.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode/version and init: CU runs in SA mode; initializes RAN context and F1 identifiers.
- Immediate config validation error:
  - `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: sst: 9999999 invalid value, authorized range: 0 255`.
  - `[ENB_APP] [CONFIG] config_execcheck: section ...snssaiList.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`.
  - `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- Consequence: CU exits before starting SCTP/F1C/NGAP, so it never listens on its F1-C endpoint (`127.0.0.5:501`).

Cross-check with `cu_conf`: `gNBs.plmn_list.snssaiList.sst=9999999` matches the error and is outside 0–255. This parameter controls NSSAI SST advertised via SIB/NGAP; OAI validates range per 3GPP limits and aborts on violation.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC and radio numerology correctly for n78; it computes TDD patterns and starts threads.
- F1AP client attempts to connect to CU:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
  - Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by `F1AP ... retrying...`.
- DU also logs `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`, indicating it pauses radio activation pending F1 setup.

Interpretation: With CU exited due to invalid SST, DU’s SCTP association to CU is refused (no listener). No PRACH/UE procedures can proceed.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with numerology matching DU: N_RB 106, SCS 30 kHz, DL=3619.2 MHz.
- RF simulator behavior: UE acts as client trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and repeatedly fails with errno(111) Connection refused.

Interpretation: In typical OAI rfsim setups, the gNB side (DU/L1) opens the server socket. Because DU is waiting on F1 setup and CU has exited, the RF simulator server is not fully available for the UE to connect, yielding repeated connection refusals.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU aborts immediately due to invalid `sst` (out of 0–255 range). This prevents F1-C listening and any RRC/NGAP procedures.
- DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (`connection refused`), and radio activation is gated on F1 setup. As a result, no rfsim server side becomes available for UE.
- UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server (`127.0.0.1:4043`), consistent with DU not fully activating due to CU absence.

Root cause: Misconfigured `gNBs.plmn_list.snssaiList.sst=9999999` at the CU. This violates allowed SST range and triggers CU config validation failure and early exit, cascading into DU/UE failures.

Standard constraints: SST is one octet (0–255). The DU and UE both use SST=1, which is valid and consistent; only the CU is invalid.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix:
- Set CU `snssaiList.sst` to a valid value, preferably `1` to match DU/UE.
- Restart CU, then DU, then UE; confirm F1AP association, NGAP registration, and UE attach.

Post-fix validation steps:
- CU should no longer print `config_check_intrange` errors.
- DU F1AP should connect without SCTP `connection refused`; F1 Setup Response should arrive and radio activates.
- UE should connect to rfsim server and proceed to detect SSB, perform PRACH, and establish RRC.

}
```

Operational checks and tools:
- Ensure CU `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` is reachable by AMF and consistent with `amf_ip_address` expectations.
- If further issues arise post-fix (e.g., PRACH failures), inspect DU PHY/MAC logs for PRACH parameters (e.g., `prach_ConfigurationIndex`, `zeroCorrelationZoneConfig`) and SIB1 encoding; however, current logs show no PRACH-related asserts.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial and without timestamps; the analysis assumes standard OAI rfsim behavior where DU radio activation is gated by F1 setup with CU.
- Only one misconfiguration is provided; other latent issues cannot be excluded but are not indicated by current logs.
- The JSON snippets include line comments for clarity; remove comments if strict JSON parsing is required.
