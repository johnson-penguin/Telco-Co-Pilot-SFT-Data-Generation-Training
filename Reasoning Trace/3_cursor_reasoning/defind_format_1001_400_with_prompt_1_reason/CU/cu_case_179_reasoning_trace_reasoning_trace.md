## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The logs indicate OAI NR SA mode with RF Simulator: CU/DU show SA mode; DU has rfsimulator server configured on port 4043; UE repeatedly attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected bring-up: CU initializes and opens F1-C listener → DU connects over F1-C and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB sync → PRACH/RACH → RRC/NAS attach.
- Misconfigured parameter: `security.integrity_algorithms[0]=nia9` in CU. OAI supports NIA0/NIA1/NIA2/NIA3; `nia9` is invalid and rejected by RRC/security config.
- Parsed config highlights:
  - CU `gNBs`: F1-C server side at `127.0.0.5` with ports c=501/d=2152; DU will connect from `127.0.0.3`. AMF IPv4 `192.168.70.132`. Security: `integrity_algorithms=["nia9","nia0"]` (invalid first entry), `ciphering_algorithms=["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"`] (all valid).
  - DU `gNBs[0]`: `local_n_address=127.0.0.3` toward CU `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5`; serving cell config matches n78, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs; PRACH index 98; TDD pattern coherent. rfsimulator: `serveraddr: "server"`, `serverport: 4043`.
  - UE: USIM credentials provided; no explicit rfsim override; from logs, it connects to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Initial mismatch: CU logs explicitly show unknown integrity algorithm `nia9`, aligning with the misconfigured parameter; this likely prevents CU from fully initializing and offering F1-C to the DU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA, prints build info and CU identifiers.
- Critical error: `[RRC]   unknown integrity algorithm "nia9" in section "security" of the configuration file`.
- Config sections continue reading, but there is no evidence of F1AP listener start or NGAP/AMF connection afterwards. This suggests CU initialization is blocked/faulted due to the invalid integrity algorithm, so CU does not reach an operational state.
- Cross-check with config: `integrity_algorithms` indeed contains `nia9` at index 0; only `nia0`, `nia1`, `nia2`, `nia3` are valid tokens.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU PHY/MAC initialization is normal: antenna config, TDD pattern, carrier frequencies (3.6192 GHz), N_RB 106; SIB1 and timers printed; no PHY assertions.
- F1AP behavior: DU attempts to connect to CU (`127.0.0.5`) repeatedly and gets `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused`, followed by F1AP retries.
- DU remains waiting: `[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → radio activation and rfsim server startup are withheld until F1 Setup completes.
- Conclusion: Orchestration layer blocked (F1-C), not PHY; consistent with CU not listening due to its config error.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes consistent PHY (N_RB 106, 3.6192 GHz, TDD).
- UE, as RFsim client, repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` connection refused.
- Since DU did not activate radio/start rfsim server (blocked on F1 Setup), the UE cannot connect; thus UE failures are secondary symptoms of the CU-side configuration fault.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence:
  - CU rejects `nia9` integrity algorithm → CU RRC/security initialization fails/halts → F1-C listener not established.
  - DU’s SCTP connection to CU is refused repeatedly → DU stays pre-activation waiting for F1 Setup.
  - DU never starts rfsim server on port 4043 → UE’s client connection attempts are refused.
- Root cause: invalid integrity algorithm token `nia9` in CU `security.integrity_algorithms`. OAI accepts only `nia0`, `nia1`, `nia2`, `nia3`. The explicit CU log confirms this misconfiguration.
- Standards and implementation context:
  - 3GPP TS 33.501 defines EIA/NIA algorithms; the commonly supported set in OAI is NIA0/NIA1/NIA2/NIA3. There is no `nia9`.
  - OAI’s config parser validates algorithm names; unknown names trigger errors at RRC/security config stage, preventing full startup.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Primary fix: replace/remove `nia9` with a supported integrity algorithm, e.g., `nia2` and/or `nia1`. A typical preference list: `["nia2","nia1","nia0","nia3"]`.
- After applying the fix, expected flow: CU starts and opens F1-C → DU connects and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio and rfsim server (4043) → UE connects to rfsim server and proceeds with RACH/RRC/NAS.
- Verification checklist:
  - CU log no longer shows unknown integrity algorithm; F1AP listener active; NGAP to AMF attempts visible.
  - DU log shows successful SCTP association and F1 Setup Complete; radio activation lines; rfsim server listening.
  - UE log shows successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043; SSB detection; RACH and RRC connection.
- Corrected configuration snippets (focused on the issue):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": [
          "nea3",
          "nea2",
          "nea1",
          "nea0"
        ],
        "integrity_algorithms": [
          "nia2",  // replaced unsupported "nia9" with supported "nia2"
          "nia1"
        ],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {},
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
}
```

- Additional hardening:
  - Validate all security algorithm lists against supported tokens before deployment.
  - Keep CU/DU F1 IP/ports coordinated (already consistent here); ensure local firewall permits SCTP on the chosen ports.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; we infer sequencing from typical OAI behavior and inter-component dependencies.
- AMF connectivity is not exercised here due to earlier failure; after fixing integrity algorithms, verify AMF reachability and NGAP establishment.
- If issues persist post-fix, check SCTP port bindings (500/501), SELinux/firewall policies, and rfsim server binding behavior on the DU.
