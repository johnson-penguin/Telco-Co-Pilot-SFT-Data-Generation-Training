## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR Standalone with rfsimulator: CU and DU operate with an F1 split, and the UE is an rfsim client attempting to connect to localhost:4043. Expected sequence: CU initializes NGAP with AMF, configures GTP-U, and starts F1AP; DU establishes F1-C SCTP to CU and, after F1 Setup, activates the radio and runs the rfsim server; UE connects to the rfsim server, performs PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session.

Network configuration (key fields):
- cu_conf.gNBs: `tr_s_preference` = "invalid_enum_value" (misconfigured), `local_s_if_name` = "lo", `local_s_address` = "127.0.0.5", `remote_s_address` = "127.0.0.3", NGAP/NGU = 192.168.8.43:2152.
- du_conf.MACRLCs: `tr_n_preference` = "f1", `local_n_address` = "127.0.0.3", `remote_n_address` = "127.0.0.5", ports consistent with CU.
- ue_conf: SIM credentials only; UE rfsim defaults visible in logs (127.0.0.1:4043).

Guiding misconfigured_param: `gNBs.tr_s_preference=invalid_enum_value`. In OAI, `tr_s_preference` selects the split/transport between CU and DU (e.g., "f1", "eth", etc.). An invalid enum prevents the CU from spawning the F1 task stack (F1AP, SCTP listener) and/or S-plane routing tied to the split. This would explain DU’s repeated SCTP connection refusals and UE’s inability to connect (DU awaits F1 setup to activate radio/rfsim server fully).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGAP threads start; NGSetupRequest/Response exchanged successfully with AMF, and GTP-U initializes fine on 192.168.8.43:2152 (gtpu instance id: 94).
- Notably missing compared to a healthy run: no "Starting F1AP at CU" line, and no SCTP bind/listener for F1-C. The log stops after creating TASK_GTPV1_U and other tasks; there is no error shown, but the absence of F1AP init suggests the CU did not create the F1 control-plane tasks.

Correlation to config: With `tr_s_preference` set to an unknown value, the CU’s configuration path that instantiates the F1 interface is skipped or fails, resulting in no F1AP task and therefore no SCTP server listening for DU.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- PHY/MAC initialize cleanly; TDD and RF parameters match N78 at 3619.2 MHz; no PHY asserts.
- DU intends F1: "Starting F1AP at DU" and "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5". GTP-U locally binds fine.
- Then repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" looping — indicating no SCTP listener on CU at 127.0.0.5.

Conclusion: DU is properly configured for F1 but cannot reach CU because CU never started F1 due to the invalid `tr_s_preference`.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config aligns with N78/106PRB; it attempts rfsim connections to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly and gets errno(111) connection refused.
- In rfsim, UE connects to the DU’s rfsim server. The DU delays full radio activation (and server accept loop) until after F1 Setup completes. Since F1 never completes, the UE’s client sees persistent connection refusals.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU initializes NGAP and GTP-U successfully but never starts F1 tasks → DU attempts to set up F1 to CU 127.0.0.5 and gets ECONNREFUSED → DU stays in "waiting for F1 Setup Response" and does not activate radio → UE’s rfsim client fails to connect.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): CU `gNBs.tr_s_preference` is set to an invalid enum. The CU therefore does not create F1AP/SCTP listener, blocking DU’s F1 setup and leaving UE unable to proceed.
- The DU and CU IPs/ports otherwise look consistent (127.0.0.3 ↔ 127.0.0.5, port 2152 for GTP-U), and CU’s NGAP path is healthy, reinforcing that the failure domain is the CU’s split selection preventing F1 creation.

Given this is transport/split configuration logic, no 3GPP PHY spec lookup is necessary; the behavior aligns with OAI control-plane task creation conditioned on `tr_s_preference`.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Set CU `gNBs.tr_s_preference` to a valid value for CU/DU split, i.e., "f1".
- Keep DU `tr_n_preference` as "f1" and the loopback addresses consistent (CU 127.0.0.5, DU 127.0.0.3) unless your environment requires different aliases. Ensure the CU host actually has 127.0.0.5 reachable (or switch both sides to 127.0.0.1 consistently).

```

Post-fix validation:
- CU: confirm "Starting F1AP at CU" and presence of SCTP listener/bind; no errors.
- DU: observe SCTP connect success, F1 Setup Response received, radio activation log, rfsim server accepting connections.
- UE: connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds; RACH/RRC attach proceed.

Further checks if issues persist:
- If using multiple loopback aliases, ensure 127.0.0.5 is assigned on the host; otherwise, use 127.0.0.1 consistently on both CU/DU sides.
- Verify no firewall blocks SCTP between DU↔CU and that GTP-U ports don’t conflict. Ensure only one CU instance binds the chosen address.

## 7. Limitations
- CU logs are truncated with respect to explicit F1 errors; the absence of F1AP start lines combined with DU’s repeated SCTP refusals strongly indicates CU never created the F1 stack due to the invalid `tr_s_preference`.
- Exact internal OAI config parsing behavior is inferred from known patterns; if needed, enable higher log verbosity for config parsing to see explicit enum validation errors.
- This case is control-plane/split configuration; PHY/MAC parameters (e.g., PRACH) are not implicated unless further logs post-fix suggest otherwise.
