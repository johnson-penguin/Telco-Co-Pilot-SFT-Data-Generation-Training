## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- Expected setup: OAI NR in SA mode with `--rfsim` and F1 split (CU/DU). Normal bring-up: CU reads config → starts F1-C server; DU reads config → attempts F1AP association to CU; if F1 established, DU activates radio and rfsim server; UE starts and connects to DU rfsim at `127.0.0.1:4043`; after SSB/PRACH, RRC and PDU session follow.
- Misconfigured parameter provided: **gNBs.gNB_ID=None** (in CU). In OAI, `gNB_ID` is mandatory in `gNBs` for both CU and DU; an absent or invalid value can break the config parser.
- Quick parse of network_config:
  - CU `cu_conf.gNBs`: object with `gNB_name`, TAC, `plmn_list`, `nr_cellid`, F1 addresses (`local_s_address 127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address 127.0.0.3`), NG interfaces, AMF IP. Notably, there is **no `gNB_ID` field** and the logs show a configuration syntax error.
  - DU `du_conf.gNBs[0]`: has `gNB_ID="0xe00"`, `gNB_DU_ID="0xe00"`, PHY/MAC/RU/RFSIM present; F1 towards CU `remote_n_address 127.0.0.5` and local `127.0.0.3`.
  - UE `ue_conf`: IMSI/key/opc present; no RF sim server here (UE takes it from cmdline or defaults to `127.0.0.1:4043`).
- Initial mismatch: CU lacks `gNB_ID` and CU logs show libconfig init failure; this would prevent CU from opening F1-C SCTP server. DU’s repeated SCTP connection refused and UE’s rfsim connection refused cascade from CU’s failure (DU keeps radio deactivated until F1 Setup Response).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Key lines:
  - `[LIBCONFIG] ... cu_case_102.conf - line 11: syntax error`
  - `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded` → `init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed` → `Getting configuration failed` → `function config_libconfig_init returned -1`.
- Interpretation:
  - The CU config parsing fails immediately, so no F1AP task is started and no SCTP server is bound on `127.0.0.5:500/501`.
  - Given the provided misconfiguration, the likely culprit is an invalid or missing `gNB_ID` declaration under `gNBs` (e.g., a line equivalent to `gNBs.gNB_ID=None` in libconfig syntax, or a JSON-to-libconfig conversion that produced an invalid token). CU therefore never reaches NGAP/AMF or F1 initialization.
- Cross-reference with `cu_conf.gNBs` in network_config: No `gNB_ID` present; this aligns with the parser error and the declared misconfigured parameter.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU brings up MAC/PHY and prepares TDD, frequency 3619.2 MHz (n78), and prints ServingCellConfigCommon and TDD pattern. No PHY asserts or PRACH errors.
- F1AP behavior:
  - `Starting F1AP at DU`
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5 ...`
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and `F1AP unsuccessful result ... retrying...`
- Interpretation:
  - Connection refused means there is nothing listening on CU’s F1-C address/port; consistent with CU failing at config parsing.
  - DU logs: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → RF/rfsim server is not activated yet, so UE cannot connect to the rfsim port.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY at 3619.2 MHz, threads start, then acts as rfsim client:
  - `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043`
  - `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` repeated.
- Interpretation:
  - Errno 111 (connection refused) indicates no rfsim server listening. In OAI, the DU runs the rfsim server but delays activation until after F1 Setup (DU log explicitly mentions waiting). Since CU failed, DU never activates the server, hence UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline linkage:
  - CU config parse fails at startup due to invalid `gNB_ID` → CU never starts F1-C server.
  - DU repeatedly attempts F1AP association to CU and is refused → DU never receives F1 Setup Response → DU keeps radio inactive and does not start rfsim server.
  - UE, acting as rfsim client, repeatedly fails to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (no server) → cannot proceed to search/attach.
- Root cause centered on misconfigured parameter:
  - The provided misconfigured parameter is exactly the absence/invalidity of `gNBs.gNB_ID` in the CU configuration. This is mandatory and must be a valid integer (often hex string like `0xe00`) within the OAI config. Setting it to `None` (or having it missing) breaks the libconfig parser (syntax error) and halts initialization.
- No evidence of PRACH/PHY issues; all downstream errors are cascading effects of CU not starting.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Immediate fix:
  - Add a valid `gNB_ID` to CU `gNBs`. OAI commonly uses the same base ID as DU for consistency in split mode. Example: set `"gNB_ID": "0xe00"` under CU `gNBs`.
  - Ensure `gNBs` structure matches OAI expectations. Many OAI JSON configs wrap `gNBs` as an array; if your converter expects an array, use `gNBs: [ { ... } ]`. Either way, the key is that `gNB_ID` is present and valid.
  - After fixing CU, verify CU binds F1-C on `127.0.0.5:500/501`; DU should then establish F1, activate radio, and start rfsim server; UE connects to `127.0.0.1:4043` and proceeds to cell search/attach.

- Suggested corrected snippets (JSON within network_config shape):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-CU"],
    "Asn1_verbosity": "none",
    "Num_Threads_PUSCH": 8,
    "gNBs": {
      "gNB_ID": "0xe00",               // ADDED: mandatory and non-null
      "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
      "tracking_area_code": 1,
      "plmn_list": { "mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2, "snssaiList": { "sst": 1 } },
      "nr_cellid": 1,
      "tr_s_preference": "f1",
      "local_s_if_name": "lo",

      "local_s_portc": 501,
      "local_s_portd": 2152,
      "remote_s_portc": 500,
      "remote_s_portd": 2152,
      "SCTP": { "SCTP_INSTREAMS": 2, "SCTP_OUTSTREAMS": 2 },
      "amf_ip_address": { "ipv4": "192.168.70.132" },
      "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",

        "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optional structural variant if your pipeline requires an array (functionally equivalent):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "gNB_ID": "0xe00",
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
        "tracking_area_code": 1,
        "plmn_list": { "mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2, "snssaiList": { "sst": 1 } },
        "nr_cellid": 1,
        "tr_s_preference": "f1",
        "local_s_if_name": "lo",
        "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
        "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3",
        "local_s_portc": 501,
        "local_s_portd": 2152,
        "remote_s_portc": 500,
        "remote_s_portd": 2152,
        "SCTP": { "SCTP_INSTREAMS": 2, "SCTP_OUTSTREAMS": 2 },
        "amf_ip_address": { "ipv4": "192.168.70.132" },
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- Further checks after fix:
  - CU logs should show `F1AP: Listening on 127.0.0.5:500` and NGAP init; DU should show `F1 Setup Response received` and radio activation; UE should connect to rfsim and proceed to SSB detection.
  - If CU still errors, validate JSON→libconfig transformation step to ensure `gNB_ID` renders as a valid integer (not `None`) and that commas/quotes are correct.

## 7. Limitations

- CU log shows only the parse failure without the exact offending line, but the provided misconfigured parameter and absence of `gNB_ID` in `cu_conf.gNBs` strongly indicate the root cause.
- Logs lack timestamps; correlation is inferred from repeated SCTP connection refusals and UE rfsim connection refusals.
- No need for 3GPP spec lookup here because the failure is at config parsing, not radio procedure; the behavior matches OAI’s F1/rfsim activation sequence.
