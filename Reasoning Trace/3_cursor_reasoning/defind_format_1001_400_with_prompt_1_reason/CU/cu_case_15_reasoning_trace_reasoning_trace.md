## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- OAI NR SA with rfsim: CU/DU/UE run with "--rfsim --sa"; UE tries 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU loads config → NGAP toward AMF + F1-C listener → DU F1AP association → DU activates radio + rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim → SSB/RA → RRC/NAS attach.
- Misconfigured parameter: gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=999.999.999.999 (invalid IPv4). CU logs show it parsing that exact value and later fatal error in SCTP task when resolving AMF address.
- network_config summaries (extracted):
  - cu_conf.gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES has NG-AMF IPv4 set to "999.999.999.999" (invalid). Also has an `amf_ip_address.ipv4` set to "192.168.70.132" (valid), but logs indicate CU actually used the NETWORK_INTERFACES value.
  - du_conf is sane (n78 @ 3619.2 MHz, µ=1, BW 106 PRBs, PRACH idx 98; F1 DU 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5).
  - ue_conf IMSI 001010000000001, SST 1; UE acts as rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Initial mismatch: Invalid NG-AMF IPv4 in CU config causes name resolution failure at NGAP/SCTP setup time, crashing CU; DU can’t complete F1; UE can’t connect to rfsim.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Normal early init: SA mode, RAN context, F1AP CU identifiers, tasks spawned (SCTP, NGAP, RRC, GTPU).
- Critical clues:
  - "Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 999.999.999.999" → CU accepted the invalid string from NETWORK_INTERFACES.
  - Assertion failure in `sctp_handle_new_association_req()` with `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999) failed: Name or service not known` → NGAP/SCTP cannot resolve/connect to the AMF because the IP is invalid; CU asserts and exits (`_Assert_Exit_`).
  - CU also logs F1AP startup, but the assert aborts the process, so F1 listener stability is compromised; process exits.
- Cross-reference with config: Both `amf_ip_address.ipv4` (valid) and `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` (invalid) are present; runtime clearly preferred the NETWORK_INTERFACES value.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU and TDD config correctly and starts F1AP.
- Repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" + retries, and "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio".
- Explanation: CU crashed from NGAP address resolution failure, so F1-C at CU is not available; DU can’t complete F1, radio stays inactive, rfsim server not started.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for FR1, µ=1, BW 106; acts as rfsim client.
- Repeated connection refused to 127.0.0.1:4043 → rfsim server not active.
- Cause: DU defers radio/rfsim activation until after F1 Setup Response; CU crash prevents it.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU takes invalid NG-AMF IP from NETWORK_INTERFACES, fails `getaddrinfo`, asserts, exits.
  - DU cannot complete F1 association with CU; remains pre-activation; rfsim not started.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim; no radio.
- Root cause: Misconfigured `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` set to an invalid IPv4 string. Despite a valid `amf_ip_address.ipv4` also present, CU chose the NETWORK_INTERFACES value, leading directly to the crash.
- No evidence of PRACH/SIB issues; failure occurs at NGAP/SCTP setup stage before UE procedures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Config corrections (choose one consistent approach):
  - Prefer NETWORK_INTERFACES (recommended) and set a valid AMF IPv4; remove conflicting legacy fields.
  - Or use `amf_ip_address.ipv4` exclusively with a valid IPv4; ensure code path uses it.
- Corrected snippets (within the provided network_config structure):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.70.132", // FIX: valid AMF IP replacing 999.999.999.999
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
        "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
      },
      "amf_ip_address": { "ipv4": "192.168.70.132" } // keep consistent, or remove if unused
    }
  }
}
```

- Verification steps after change:
  - Start CU; ensure no `getaddrinfo` errors; NGAP should attempt association to AMF successfully (or at least resolve address).
  - Start DU; confirm F1 Setup completes; see DU "activating radio" and rfsim server starts.
  - UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043; observe SSB/RA → RRC attach. Then confirm NGAP registration with AMF and PDU session.
- Further diagnostics if issues persist:
  - If both NETWORK_INTERFACES and `amf_ip_address` exist, verify which one OAI uses in your branch; remove the unused one to avoid ambiguity.
  - Validate IP reachability to AMF host (routes/firewall) after fixing syntax/value.
  - Increase logging for NGAP/SCTP to catch association errors unrelated to addressing.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; precise F1 listener lifecycle at CU around the assert is inferred. However, the getaddrinfo failure clearly explains CU abort.
- Extracted network_config shows both addressing styles; different OAI versions may prioritize one; this analysis assumes current logs reflect resolution from NETWORK_INTERFACES.
- No external tool lookup needed; the error is explicit and consistent with invalid IPv4 handling in OAI SCTP/NGAP setup.
