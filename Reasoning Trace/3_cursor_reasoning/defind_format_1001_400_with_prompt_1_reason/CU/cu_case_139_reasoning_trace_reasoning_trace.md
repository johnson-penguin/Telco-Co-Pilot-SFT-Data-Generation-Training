## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR SA mode using RF simulator. CU and DU start separately with F1 split (`tr_s_preference: f1` on CU, `tr_n_preference: f1` on DU). UE is RFsim client attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Expected bring-up:
- CU initializes RRC/NGAP, opens F1-C (SCTP server) to accept DU.
- DU initializes PHY/MAC, attempts F1-C SCTP association to CU (`127.0.0.5:500`). After F1 Setup, DU “activates radio,” enabling the RFsim server on port 4043.
- UE RFsim client connects to RFsim server (DU) → sync → PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.

Network config key points (parsed):
- CU `security.integrity_algorithms`: ["", "nia0"] — the first entry is an empty string (misconfigured).
- CU F1 addresses: CU `local_s_address: 127.0.0.5`, DU `remote_n_address: 127.0.0.5`; DU `local_n_address: 127.0.0.3`; ports `remote_n_portc: 501` (CU) and `local_n_portc: 500` (DU). Matches DU logs.
- DU radio: n78, 106 PRBs, µ=1, TDD config consistent with logs; PRACH index 98 etc. No obvious PHY invalidity.
- UE: only USIM/DNN provided; RFsim defaults implied; UE tries `127.0.0.1:4043` per logs.

Immediate mismatch from logs and config:
- CU log: `[RRC] unknown integrity algorithm "" in section "security"` aligns with `misconfigured_param: security.integrity_algorithms[0]=` (empty). This likely prevents CU RRC from completing security capability configuration and thus CU operational readiness, impacting F1.

Conclusion for setup: The CU security config error plausibly blocks F1 server readiness, cascading to DU F1 connection failures and UE RFsim connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode confirmation: running SA, rfsim; build info present.
- RAN context for CU shows `RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0, RC.nb_RU = 0` (expected for CU-only).
- Critical error: `[RRC]   unknown integrity algorithm "" in section "security" of the configuration file`.
- Afterward, only config-reading messages; no evidence of F1-C server start or NGAP establishment in the excerpt.

Interpretation:
- The empty integrity algorithm entry is not recognized by CU RRC config loader. OAI typically validates `nia0/nia1/nia2/nia3`. An empty string fails validation, likely causing RRC to either abort or continue with an inconsistent security capability set.
- The absence of CU-side F1AP server readiness logs combined with DU-side connection refusals indicates CU did not open the F1-C SCTP endpoint, consistent with an initialization failure upstream (RRC/security).

Cross-reference with `gnb_conf` (CU):
- `security.integrity_algorithms` contains an invalid first entry; this matches the log error verbatim.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 successfully; TDD, bandwidth, antenna ports, SIB1/TDA, and SSB frequency lines are consistent with config.
- F1AP start: attempts to connect from DU `127.0.0.3` to CU `127.0.0.5` on control port; repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` with retries.
- DU is “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.” This lines up with OAI behavior: radio activation (including RFsim server ability to accept UE) occurs after successful F1 Setup with CU.

Interpretation:
- The DU is healthy but cannot establish F1 because the CU is not accepting SCTP connections. This is a downstream symptom of the CU configuration error.

Link to `gnb_conf` (DU):
- Addresses/ports match; PRACH and PHY config show no red flags causing DU crashes. Failures are strictly on F1 connect due to refusal on the CU side.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY with µ=1 and 106 PRBs at 3619.2 MHz, consistent with DU.
- UE acts as RFsim client attempting TCP connections to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Repeated `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` (connection refused) indicates no server is listening.

Interpretation:
- DU’s RF simulator server is not up because DU did not “activate radio” (gated on F1 Setup). Therefore the UE cannot attach to the RFsim server.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Time/order correlation:
  - CU hits an RRC config error on integrity algorithms at startup.
  - CU fails to expose F1-C server (or remains in an incomplete init state).
  - DU tries to connect via SCTP to CU, gets “connection refused,” so F1 Setup never completes and DU does not activate radio.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim server on 4043 → repeated errno(111).
- Known OAI behavior: invalid security algorithm names cause RRC config parsing errors and may block further bring-up of F1/NGAP.
- `misconfigured_param` explicitly points to `security.integrity_algorithms[0]=` being empty, which matches the CU log error.

Root cause:
- The CU `gnb.conf` has an invalid entry for `security.integrity_algorithms[0]` (empty string). This breaks CU RRC security configuration, preventing CU from fully initializing and accepting F1 connections. All other failures (DU F1 SCTP refused, UE RFsim connect refused) are cascading effects.

Spec/implementation basis:
- Valid NR integrity algorithms are NIA0 (null), NIA1, NIA2, NIA3, commonly exposed in OAI as `nia0`, `nia1`, `nia2`, `nia3`. An empty string is invalid.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix CU security configuration by setting valid integrity algorithms in preference order (e.g., `nia2`, `nia1`, `nia0`; optionally include `nia3` if enabled in build):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        // Changed: remove invalid empty string and prefer strong-first ordering
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia1", "nia0"],
        // Keep ciphering as-is (already valid)
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- After the change, restart CU first; verify CU logs no longer show the integrity error and that F1AP server is listening. Then start DU; confirm F1 Setup completes and DU activates radio; finally start UE and confirm RFsim connection succeeds.

- Optional validation steps:
  - Verify CU responds to SCTP on F1-C IP/port prior to DU start (e.g., using `ss -ltnp` on CU host or OAI log lines indicating F1 server readiness).
  - In OAI logs, ensure NGAP to AMF also initializes (not shown here but orthogonal to this issue).
  - If build supports `nia3`, you may use `["nia3", "nia2", "nia1", "nia0"]` for completeness.

- No changes needed on DU PRACH/TDD parameters or UE USIM for this particular issue.

For completeness, here are minimal corrected snippets in the original structure (other fields unchanged):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia1", "nia0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {},
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
}
```

## 7. Limitations
- CU log excerpt ends after config reads; we infer missing F1 server readiness from DU’s repeated SCTP refusals and the CU’s security error.
- UE config excerpt omits explicit RFsim fields; we rely on UE logs for `127.0.0.1:4043` target.
- Full NGAP/AMF state is not shown; however, this does not affect the identified root cause.
- The recommendation assumes OAI build supports `nia1/nia2/nia0` string identifiers; if a different naming is used in a specific branch, adjust accordingly.
