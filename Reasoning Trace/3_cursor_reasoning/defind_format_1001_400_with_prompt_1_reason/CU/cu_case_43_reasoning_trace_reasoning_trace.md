## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs show an OAI 5G NR Standalone run with rfsimulator: CU and DU start with F1 split (CU log: "Starting F1AP at CU"; DU log: "Starting F1AP at DU"). UE runs as rfsim client attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043. Expected flow: CU initializes NGAP to AMF, sets up F1-C with DU, configures GTP-U (F1-U), DU establishes SCTP to CU for F1-C, then DU activates radio; UE connects to rfsim server (DU), performs PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session setup.

Network configuration parsing (key fields):
- cu_conf.gNBs.tr_s_preference = "f1"; local_s_if_name = "lo"; local_s_address = "999.999.999.999"; remote_s_address = "127.0.0.3"; local_s_portd = 2152; remote_s_portd = 2152. NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/NGU = 192.168.8.43.
- du_conf.MACRLCs: tr_n_preference = "f1"; local_n_address = "127.0.0.3"; remote_n_address = "127.0.0.5"; portd = 2152. DU rfsimulator.serveraddr = "server" (DU runs as rfsim server on 4043).
- ue_conf: IMSI and DNN only (RF and rfsim address implied by defaults: 127.0.0.1:4043 as per UE logs).

Misconfigured parameter provided: gNBs.local_s_address=999.999.999.999 (in CU). This is the CU-side local F1-U/GTP-U bind address used by CU-UP side in SA with F1. An invalid IP literal guarantees socket init failure at CU for GTP-U and can also break F1-C if reused.

Initial mismatch: DU expects CU F1-C at 127.0.0.5 (du_conf.MACRLCs.remote_n_address), while CU attempts to bind/use 999.999.999.999 for its S-plane (CU log confirms). This will cascade: CU aborts, DU cannot connect F1-C (connection refused), UE cannot connect rfsim server because DU holds radio activation waiting on F1 setup.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode, NGAP toward AMF OK: "Send NGSetupRequest" and "Received NGSetupResponse" indicate AMF connectivity fine via 192.168.8.43.
- F1 start: "Starting F1AP at CU" then crucial lines:
  - "F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 999.999.999.999" → CU tries to open F1-C SCTP socket referencing the bad address.
  - "Initializing UDP for local address 999.999.999.999 with port 2152" → GTP-U init on invalid local address.
  - "getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known" → address resolution fails; "can't create GTP-U instance"; gtpu instance id -1.
  - Immediate assertion: "Assertion (getCxt(instance)->gtpInst > 0) failed! In F1AP_CU_task() ... Failed to create CU F1-U UDP listener" followed by exit.

Interpretation: CU-side S-plane (GTP-U) depends on valid bind. Invalid local_s_address causes GTP-U creation to fail, which triggers an assert in F1AP CU task path and terminates the process before F1-C completes.

Cross-ref to cu_conf: local_s_address indeed set to the invalid literal 999.999.999.999. The CU also uses loopback for NGAP endpoints (192.168.8.43) successfully, so the only fatal is the S-plane bind.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC and prepares TDD config correctly; no PHY asserts.
- F1-C intent: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" — DU tries to connect to CU at 127.0.0.5.
- Repeated failures: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" followed by retries; also "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" — DU is blocked on F1 setup.

Interpretation: Because CU exited due to the GTP-U assert, there is no SCTP listener at the CU side (127.0.0.5). Hence the DU gets ECONNREFUSED repeatedly and never proceeds to activate radio or rfsim server processing beyond listening state.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes RF to 3619.2 MHz (N78) consistent with DU.
- UE runs as rfsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 with errno 111 (connection refused).

Interpretation: In the OAI rfsim model, UE connects to the DU’s rfsim server on localhost:4043. Since the DU does not transition to active radio (it waits for F1 Setup Response), the server is not accepting connections, so UE gets repeated connection refused.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU reaches NGAP OK → attempts F1/GTP-U init with invalid local_s_address → getaddrinfo failure → CU asserts and exits. DU starts after/independently, attempts SCTP to CU 127.0.0.5 → refused (no CU). UE attempts rfsim connect → refused (DU not active because F1 not established).
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): CU `gNBs.local_s_address` is set to an invalid IPv4 literal (999.999.999.999). This breaks CU’s GTP-U initialization and, due to OAI’s assert path, aborts F1-C establishment. Downstream effects: DU cannot connect F1-C; UE cannot connect to rfsim server.
- Secondary consistency: DU expects CU at 127.0.0.5, and CU’s `remote_s_address` points to 127.0.0.3 (DU), which is consistent for F1-U direction; but CU’s own local_s_address must be a valid interface on the CU host (commonly 127.0.0.5 in OAI examples when using loopback). Using an invalid IP guarantees failure even if routing could have worked.

No 3GPP spec consultation is required here because the failure is purely transport/socket-level (getaddrinfo/bind). The behavior aligns with OAI NR softmodem error handling for invalid addresses.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix:
- Set CU `gNBs.local_s_address` to a valid CU loopback/interface IP reachable by DU. Given DU connects to CU at 127.0.0.5, use 127.0.0.5 for CU’s S-plane and F1-C bind where applicable.
- Ensure symmetry: DU `remote_n_address` must match CU’s F1-C bind; CU `remote_s_address` should remain the DU’s address (127.0.0.3) for S-plane.

  }
}
```

Validation steps after change:
- Start CU and confirm GTP-U init shows local address 127.0.0.5 with a valid gtpu instance id (>0), and F1AP does not assert.
- Start DU and observe SCTP connects to 127.0.0.5; F1 Setup Response received; DU logs transition from "waiting for F1 Setup Response" to "activating radio".
- Start UE and confirm successful connection to 127.0.0.1:4043; PRACH and RRC attach proceed.

Further diagnostics if issues persist:
- Verify the CU host has 127.0.0.5 assigned or use 127.0.0.1 consistently on both ends (update DU remote_n_address accordingly). In many OAI examples, 127.0.0.1 is sufficient if ports are distinct; when multiple instances are used, distinct loopback aliases (like 127.0.0.5) must be configured on the host.
- Check firewall/SELinux and that ports 2152 (GTP-U) and SCTP F1-C ports are open. Ensure no stale processes are holding sockets.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs lack explicit timestamps and full F1-C port details; however, the fatal CU assert unambiguously indicates socket initialization failure due to invalid local_s_address.
- The provided JSON does not include explicit CU F1-C bind IP separate from S-plane; OAI typically uses these fields for both F1-C and F1-U contexts depending on configuration paths. The corrective action aligns with the observed CU log lines referencing the bad address for both F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ and GTP-U init.
- No 3GPP physical-layer parameters are implicated; the failure is transport-level. If additional failures occur post-fix, revisit PHY/MAC configs (PRACH, TDD) and SIB.
