## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- Running OAI NR SA with rfsim: CU/DU/UE logs show "--rfsim --sa"; DU is rfsim server (port 4043), UE is client repeatedly attempting 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected call flow: CU boots → NGAP setup to AMF → CU starts F1AP server and GTP-U listener (F1-U) → DU connects F1-C to CU, completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio (rfsim server) → UE connects to rfsim server, performs SSB sync → PRACH/RA → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured_param: gNBs.local_s_address=abc.def.ghi.jkl (CU). This is a non-resolvable hostname used for F1-C/F1-U binding in CU, expected to break socket setup.
- Network config parsing (relevant):
  - CU `gNBs.tr_s_preference=f1`, `local_s_address=abc.def.ghi.jkl`, `remote_s_address=127.0.0.3`, `local_s_portc=501`, `local_s_portd=2152`. `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/GU=192.168.8.43` (matches CU logs for NGAP/GTPU toward AMF).
  - DU MACRLC/F1: `local_n_address=127.0.0.3` (DU), `remote_n_address=127.0.0.5` (CU), ports {c:500/501, d:2152}. DU F1AP log confirms: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 127.0.0.3".
  - UE rfsim client connects to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Immediate mismatch: CU intends to bind/control to `abc.def.ghi.jkl` for F1/GTP-U, but DU expects CU control at 127.0.0.5. This contradiction will prevent F1 setup and consequently UE traffic.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU initializes correctly for SA, parses AMF IP 192.168.8.43, sends NGSetupRequest and receives NGSetupResponse (NGAP OK). GTP-U toward AMF initializes with local 192.168.8.43:2152 initially (control-plane NGU path ok).
- When starting F1AP at CU: "F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for abc.def.ghi.jkl" followed by GTP-U re-init "local address abc.def.ghi.jkl" and immediate resolver failure: "getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known"; then "can't create GTP-U instance"; created gtpu instance id -1.
- Assertion trips: `getCxt(instance)->gtpInst > 0` in `f1ap_cu_task.c:126` with message "Failed to create CU F1-U UDP listener" → OAI exits. This indicates CU cannot bind F1-U due to invalid `local_s_address`.
- Cross-reference: CU never reaches a state to accept F1-C SCTP associations, so DU connection attempts will fail.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU PHY/MAC config proceeds normally (band 78, N_RB 106, TDD pattern). No PRACH/PHY errors.
- DU networking:
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 127.0.0.3" aligns with DU `local_n_address` and `remote_n_address`.
  - Repeated "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" with retries, and gatekeeping message "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio".
- Interpretation: CU-side F1-C listener is not up (CU exited after assertion), hence SCTP connect refused. DU keeps retrying and never activates radio/rfsim server.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY, configures TDD, attempts to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all failing with errno(111) Connection refused.
- This is expected because the DU never activated radio (rfsim server) due to missing F1 Setup with CU.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU exits early when trying to set up F1AP/GTP-U with `local_s_address=abc.def.ghi.jkl` → name resolution fails → assertion → CU down.
  - DU repeatedly attempts SCTP to CU at 127.0.0.5, receives connection refused since CU isn't listening.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server because DU never transitions past "waiting for F1 Setup Response" to start the RF server.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured_param:
  - The CU `gNBs.local_s_address` is invalid and does not match the DU’s expected CU address. OAI attempts `getaddrinfo()` on `abc.def.ghi.jkl` for F1-U and F1-C binding, which fails, leading to CU abort.
  - Additionally, there is a topology mismatch: DU expects CU at 127.0.0.5 while CU config points to an arbitrary hostname. Even if resolvable, it should be the CU’s actual local IP that the DU uses as `remote_n_address`.
- Therefore, the primary fix is to set `gNBs.local_s_address` in CU to a valid, local, bindable IP that matches the DU’s `remote_n_address` (127.0.0.5). Ensure ports and NGU/NGAP addresses remain consistent.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Configuration corrections:
  - Set CU `gNBs.local_s_address` to `"127.0.0.5"` to match DU `remote_n_address` and logs. This enables CU to bind its F1-C/F1-U sockets and accept DU connections.
  - Verify CU `gNBs.remote_s_address` remains `"127.0.0.3"` (DU), matching DU `local_n_address`.
  - Keep NG interfaces as-is: `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/GU = 192.168.8.43` since NGAP/GTPU to AMF already succeeded.
  - After the fix, expected behavior: CU starts F1AP listener, DU SCTP connects, F1 Setup completes, DU activates radio (rfsim server on 4043), UE client connects and progresses to RACH/RRC.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```
- Operational checks after change:
  - From CU host, ensure `127.0.0.5` is usable (loopback alias present if required) or replace with an interface IP reachable by DU; update DU accordingly.
  - Confirm DNS/hosts not required anymore; using explicit IP avoids name resolution issues seen in logs.
  - Re-run: verify CU doesn’t assert; DU F1AP shows successful SCTP association and F1 Setup; UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Further analysis/tools if issues persist:
  - Netstat/ss to confirm listeners on CU (`:501 SCTP`, `:2152 UDP`), and DU connection state.
  - Packet capture on loopback to confirm SCTP INIT/INIT-ACK and GTP-U binding.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; analysis infers sequence based on typical OAI behavior.
- The UE and DU network namespaces/loopback aliasing are not shown; using 127.0.0.5 assumes proper loopback alias configuration or container networking.
- No need for spec lookup; issue is socket binding/name resolution, not radio parameters. If radio proceeded, additional mismatches (e.g., PRACH) would be next checks, but DU/UE never reached that stage here.
