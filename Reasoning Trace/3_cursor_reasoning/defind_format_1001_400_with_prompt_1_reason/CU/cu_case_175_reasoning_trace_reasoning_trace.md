## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Scenario**: OAI SA with `--rfsim --sa`. Components: CU (F1-C/SCTP server to DU, NGAP to AMF), DU (F1-C client to CU, rfsimulator server), UE (rfsimulator client to DU).
- **Expected flow**: CU loads config → starts F1-C server and NGAP to AMF → DU connects via F1-C and activates radio/rfsim → UE connects to rfsim → SSB detection/PRACH → RRC → PDU session.
- **Misconfigured parameter (given)**: `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=999.999.999.999` (invalid IPv4 literal). This can cause config parsing failure and certainly prevents CU from reaching AMF.
- **Network config (parsed)**:
  - `cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address=127.0.0.3` (matches DU F1 peer logs). `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43` is present here, but the misconfigured live file (referenced by CU logs) likely uses the legacy `amf_ip_address` block where the invalid IP resides, triggering `libconfig` parse error.
  - `du_conf`: Serving cell Band n78, SCS µ=1, 106 PRBs, PRACH index 98. F1-C target CU 127.0.0.5; rfsimulator server at port 4043.
  - `ue_conf`: SIM credentials only; default rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043 observed in logs.
- **Initial mismatch signals**:
  - CU logs show immediate `libconfig` syntax error and abort during config load. This is consistent with an invalid IP token in the config (`999.999.999.999`).
  - DU repeatedly fails to connect F1-C to CU (`Connection refused`), and defers radio activation pending F1 Setup Response.
  - UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, consistent with DU not having activated radio/rfsim due to missing F1.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Key lines:
  - `[LIBCONFIG] ... line 91: syntax error`
  - `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`, `init aborted`, `Getting configuration failed`, `config_libconfig_init returned -1`
  - CMDLINE shows `-O .../error_conf/cu_case_16.conf` was used.
- Interpretation:
  - The CU never reaches F1AP or NGAP init; it fails at configuration parsing. In OAI, `libconfig` expects IPv4 values to be valid tokens; `999.999.999.999` is not a legal IPv4 and can cause a syntax error if not quoted/validated.
  - Because CU exits early, it does not bind F1-C on `127.0.0.5:501/500`, nor NGAP towards AMF.
- Cross-reference:
  - Although `network_config.cu_conf.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43` looks fine, the actual file used by the run appears different (legacy `amf_ip_address` with invalid IPv4). The error location (line 91) aligns with common positioning of the AMF address block.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Initialization proceeds through PHY/MAC/RRC setup; serving cell n78 with SSB at 641280; TDD pattern configured.
- F1AP client attempts:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by `F1AP ... retrying...`
- State:
  - `GNB_APP waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → DU does not activate radio nor rfsim server in this state.
- Conclusion:
  - DU is healthy but blocked by CU unavailability; F1 cannot establish because CU never started F1-C.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- RF and PHY init consistent with n78 µ=1, 106 PRBs.
- rfsimulator client behavior:
  - `Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side`
  - Repeated `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` → `connect() ... failed, errno(111)`
- Interpretation:
  - No server is listening at 127.0.0.1:4043 because DU withheld starting rfsim pending F1 Setup with CU.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU aborts immediately due to config parse error → F1-C not up on 127.0.0.5.
  - DU F1-C client to 127.0.0.5 gets `ECONNREFUSED` repeatedly → DU remains in pre-activation state.
  - UE rfsim client fails to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 → no radio server because DU never activated.
- Given misconfigured parameter: an invalid AMF IPv4 (`999.999.999.999`) in the CU config is consistent with `libconfig` syntax error and is sufficient to prevent CU startup.
- Root cause: CU configuration contains an invalid `amf_ip_address` IPv4 literal, causing `libconfig` parsing failure. This cascades into DU F1 connection failures and UE rfsim connection failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Immediate fix in CU config:
  - Replace the invalid `gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=999.999.999.999` with a valid IPv4 of the reachable AMF (e.g., `127.0.0.1` for local, or the real AMF IP). Ensure correct structure per OAI (array of AMFs with `ipv4` and `port`).
  - Verify that CU uses consistent schema: either `NETWORK_INTERFACES` (new style) or `amf_ip_address` (legacy); avoid mixing conflicting blocks.
- Sanity checks after fix:
  - Start CU and confirm it binds F1-C on `127.0.0.5` and establishes NGAP to AMF.
  - Observe DU receiving F1 Setup Response and activating radio; rfsim server should listen on `127.0.0.1:4043`.
  - UE should then connect to rfsim and proceed to SSB/PRACH and RRC.
- Corrected configuration snippets (illustrative, aligned to given `network_config` structure):
  - CU (`cu_conf`): ensure a valid AMF address and consistency with F1 addresses.

  }
}
```
  - Notes:
    - Set `amf_ip_address[0].ipv4` to a valid IPv4 (e.g., `127.0.0.1`), replacing the invalid value. If using only the newer `NETWORK_INTERFACES` style in your OAI branch, remove the legacy `amf_ip_address` block and keep `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` consistent.
  - DU (`du_conf`): no change required for this issue; ensure F1 peer remains `127.0.0.5` and rfsim port `4043`.
  - UE (`ue_conf`): optional explicit rfsim client config if your branch supports it; otherwise defaults are fine once DU is up.

- Additional validation steps:
  - Check CU log for `NGAP` connection to AMF and `F1AP` server listening messages.
  - Check DU for `F1 Setup Response` and transition to `radio activated`.
  - If issues persist, verify firewall rules for SCTP 500/501 and UDP GTP-U 2152.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; precise ordering inferred from typical OAI behavior.
- The provided `network_config.cu_conf` shows `NETWORK_INTERFACES` with a valid AMF IP, but the run-time file (indicated by CU log path) likely differs and includes the invalid `amf_ip_address`; this analysis assumes the misconfigured parameter is indeed present in that used file.
- No external spec lookup was required; the failure occurs at configuration parse time rather than a 3GPP procedure.
