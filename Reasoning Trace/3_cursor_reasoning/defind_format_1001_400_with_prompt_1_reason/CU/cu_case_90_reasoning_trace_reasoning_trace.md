### 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The run is OAI NR SA with RF simulator: CU/DU split over F1, UE connects to the rfsimulator server. Logs show DU starting with SA, F1 towards CU at `127.0.0.5`, and UE trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected flow: initialize CU and DU → F1AP association → DU activates radio (RFsim server listens) → UE connects to RFsim → SSB sync → RACH/RA → RRC attach → NGAP to AMF.
- Immediate red flag from CU logs: libconfig fails to parse CU config due to a syntax error. When CU fails, F1 at DU cannot connect (connection refused), so DU never activates radio and the UE cannot connect to the RFsim server (errno 111 repeated).
- Provided misconfigured parameter: **log_config.phy_log_level=None**. On OAI, log levels are enumerated strings such as `trace|debug|info|warn|error|fatal` (no `None`). If present in CU config, this yields a libconfig parse/validation error, explaining the CU failure.

Parsed network_config:
- cu_conf.gNBs: F1-C CU IP `127.0.0.5`, remote DU `127.0.0.3`, ports `portc 501/500`, NGU `2152`. AMF IP `192.168.70.132` and local NG interfaces set to `192.168.8.43` (not exercised because CU never gets that far). cu_conf.log_config lists several log levels but does not include `phy_log_level` (suggesting the error case file had it incorrectly set to `None`).
- du_conf: ServingCellConfigCommon with FR1 n78, SCS µ=1, BW 106RB, PRACH ConfigurationIndex 98, TDD pattern consistent with logs. rfsimulator server is configured (`serveraddr: server`, port 4043). log_config.phy_log_level is `info` (valid).
- ue_conf: IMSI/key/OPC/DNN set. No RFsim client override is shown here, but UE logs confirm RFsim client to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial inference: The misconfigured `phy_log_level=None` in the CU config leads to libconfig failure at CU startup, which cascades: DU F1 connection refused, no radio activation, UE RFsim connection refused.

### 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU errors:
  - `[LIBCONFIG] ... line 84: syntax error` → config parse fails.
  - `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded` and subsequent `config_get ... skipped` → CU cannot initialize configuration tree.
  - `init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed` → CU exits/fails to start.
  - Command line confirms CU attempted SA RFsim with `-O .../cu_case_90.conf`.
- Cross-reference: A wrong enum value like `phy_log_level=None` inside `log_config` causes parsing/validation issues in OAI configuration (CU has no PHY, and even if present, `None` is invalid). This exactly matches the misconfigured_param and explains the syntax error at the indicated line.
- Result: CU does not bring up F1-C endpoint at `127.0.0.5:500/501` and does not proceed to NGAP/GTP.

### 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC and prints cell/TDD parameters consistent with du_conf (BW 106, ABSFREQSSB 641280, band 78, µ=1). No PRACH errors; PHY setup looks fine.
- F1AP at DU: `connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` but repeatedly: `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and `Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...` → CU endpoint is not listening because CU failed earlier.
- DU prints `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → DU does not start radio and therefore RFsim server is not accepting connections.
- Conclusion: DU is blocked by missing CU. No intrinsic DU config error is indicated.

### 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY for `3619200000 Hz`, µ=1, BW 106, TDD — matches DU config.
+- UE acts as RFsim client and tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- Correlation: RFsim server runs inside DU but only after DU activates radio, which requires F1 Setup with CU. Since CU is down, DU never activates radio; thus the server port 4043 is not open, causing the UE connect failures.

### 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline linkage:
  - CU fails during config parsing → F1-C not listening.
  - DU cannot establish F1AP → stays in pre-activation state → no RFsim server.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim server at 4043 → repeated connection refusals.
- Misconfigured parameter drives the root cause: `log_config.phy_log_level=None` in the CU configuration. OAI expects valid enum strings and CU typically does not accept a `phy_log_level` field with value `None`. This mismatched/invalid value leads to libconfig syntax/validation error and aborts CU initialization. Everything else cascades from this.
- No evidence of PRACH/SIB issues; the system never reaches over-the-air phases. Network IPs/ports for F1 are otherwise consistent between CU/DU (`127.0.0.5`/`127.0.0.3`, ports 500/501), further pointing to CU config parse failure as singular root cause.

### 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix the CU configuration:
  - Remove or correct `log_config.phy_log_level`. If present, set to a valid value such as `"info"`, or omit entirely in CU configs.
  - Validate the entire `log_config` section for valid enums: `trace|debug|info|warn|error|fatal`.
- After correction, expected recovery:
  - CU starts; F1-C listens; DU F1AP connects; DU receives F1 Setup Response and activates radio; RFsim server listens on 4043; UE connects; proceed to SSB sync/RACH and RRC.
- Optional checks:
  - Ensure CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` match your AMF reachability if proceeding to NGAP (not the blocker here).
  - If further issues arise, increase `Asn1_verbosity` or set `global_log_level` to `debug` to capture more details.

Proposed corrected snippets (focused changes only):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        "global_log_level": "info",
        "hw_log_level": "info",
        "mac_log_level": "info",
        "rlc_log_level": "info",
        "pdcp_log_level": "info",
        "rrc_log_level": "info",
        "ngap_log_level": "info",
        "f1ap_log_level": "info"
        // FIX: removed invalid "phy_log_level": "None" from CU config
        // If you insist on a PHY log control in CU, use a valid value like "info"
        // but CU typically doesn’t require PHY logging level here.
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        "global_log_level": "info",
        "hw_log_level": "info",
        "phy_log_level": "info",  // already valid on DU
        "mac_log_level": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Minimal diff (if you prefer explicit CU field):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        // "phy_log_level": "None"   <-- REMOVE THIS LINE
        "phy_log_level": "info"      // OPTIONAL: only if supported in your CU build
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Edit the CU config file used at runtime (the one referenced by `-O .../cu_case_90.conf`) and remove/replace `phy_log_level=None`.
- Restart CU → wait for F1 Setup success at DU → confirm DU activates radio and RFsim announces listening → start UE and verify connection to `127.0.0.1:4043` succeeds.

### 7. Limitations

- CU log shows only the parsing failure and not the exact offending key/value; we infer from the provided `misconfigured_param` and typical OAI enums.
- Some environmental details (AMF reachability, firewall rules, exact CU config file content at line 84) are not included; after the fix, if issues persist, capture full CU/DU logs at `debug` level.
- The analysis does not require external specification lookup because the failure occurs pre-RAN activation, at configuration parsing.
