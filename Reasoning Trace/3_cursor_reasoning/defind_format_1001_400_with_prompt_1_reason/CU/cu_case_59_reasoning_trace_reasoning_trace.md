## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

Based on the logs, this scenario is OAI 5G NR Standalone with RF simulator:
- CU and DU both start in SA mode; DU shows `F1AP` attempting to connect to CU over loopback.
- UE is an RFsim client repeatedly trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and failing.

Expected SA flow: CU initializes (NGAP ready), DU initializes (F1C association to CU), DU activates radio, RFsim server becomes available, UE connects to RFsim, performs cell search/SSB, PRACH, RRC connection, registration, PDU session.

Key input: misconfigured_param = `security.ciphering_algorithms[1]=nea9`.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs: F1C CU IP `127.0.0.5`, DU peer `127.0.0.3`, ports C=501/500, D=2152. AMF IP set (out-of-scope here since F1 never establishes).
- cu_conf.security.ciphering_algorithms: `["nea3", "nea9", "nea1", "nea0"]` → contains invalid `nea9` not supported by OAI/3GPP.
- du_conf: Serving cell in n78, µ=1, 106 PRBs, PRACH index 98, TDD pattern consistent; F1C DU IP `127.0.0.3` targets CU `127.0.0.5`. RFsim configured as server listening on port 4043.
- ue_conf: IMSI/dnn provided; RF parameters match DU (3619.2 MHz DL, µ=1, 106 PRBs) from UE logs.

Initial mismatch: CU log explicitly reports unknown ciphering algorithm `nea9`. This single bad entry can abort CU’s security configuration, preventing CU from fully starting F1C/NGAP services.

Implication chain to check: Broken CU → DU cannot complete F1C (connect refused) → DU never activates RFsim server → UE cannot TCP-connect to RFsim port 4043.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Observed:
- SA mode, version banner, then: `[RRC]   unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9" in section "security" of the configuration file`.
- Config sections load messages repeat, but no evidence of SCTP/F1/NGAP listener startup.

Interpretation:
- OAI validates `security.ciphering_algorithms` against supported NEA set {nea0, nea1, nea2, nea3}. `nea9` is invalid. CU likely fails security config and does not bring up F1C listener on 127.0.0.5:501, leading to connection refusals at the DU.
- CU otherwise shows standard CU-only counts (`RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0`), expected for CU in F1 split.

Cross-reference to cu_conf:
- `security.ciphering_algorithms` includes `nea9` exactly as the log reports. This aligns with the misconfigured_param and directly explains failure before F1/NGAP setup.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Initialization is normal up to F1 setup:
- PHY/MAC config consistent with n78 µ=1, 106 PRBs; TDD pattern logs; SIB1 and frequencies align with UE logs.
- F1AP start at DU; DU attempts SCTP connect to CU `127.0.0.5`:
  - Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and `F1AP ... retrying`.
- DU prints `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → DU defers radio activation and thus RFsim server readiness until F1 is established.

Link to cu_conf params:
- DU targets CU `127.0.0.5:500/501` as configured; connection refused implies no listener on CU side, consistent with CU aborting due to invalid `nea9`.

No PHY fatal errors (PRACH etc.) are present; the blocker is strictly F1C establishment.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

UE baseband setup matches DU config (3619200000 Hz, µ=1, 106 PRBs). Then:
- UE is RFsim client, repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused).

Link to du_conf:
- `rfsimulator.serveraddr` indicates DU plays the server role on port 4043. DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio; the RFsim server typically is not accepting connections until DU is active.

Therefore, UE connection failures are secondary to the DU waiting state, which in turn is caused by CU not accepting F1 due to the invalid ciphering algorithm.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU hits `unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9"` and does not bring up F1C.
- DU attempts SCTP to CU → connection refused repeatedly; remains in pre-activation state.
- UE, as RFsim client, attempts to connect to DU server at 4043 → connection refused because DU did not activate radio/server without F1 setup.

Root cause guided by misconfigured_param:
- The invalid CU parameter `security.ciphering_algorithms[1]=nea9` is unsupported by OAI and not defined in 3GPP TS 33.501/35.2xx algorithm sets (NEA0/1/2/3 only). OAI RRC/security config rejects it, aborting CU service initialization. This cascades to DU (F1C refused) and then UE (RFsim refused).

No additional PRACH/SIB issues are indicated; all other RF parameters are mutually consistent. The single-point config error explains all downstream symptoms.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Primary fix:
- Replace `nea9` with a supported cipher, e.g., prefer ordering like `["nea2", "nea1", "nea3", "nea0"]` or simply remove `nea9`. Ensure integrity list remains valid (nia2, optionally nia1, nia0).

Secondary verifications (after fix):
- Confirm CU brings up F1C listener; DU should log successful SCTP association and F1 Setup Response; DU should activate radio; UE should connect to RFsim server at 4043 and proceed to RRC.

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON-style with comments to highlight changes):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "security": {
      "ciphering_algorithms": [
        "nea2",  // changed: removed invalid "nea9"; use supported NEA {0,1,2,3}
        "nea1",
        "nea3",
        "nea0"
      ],
      "integrity_algorithms": [
        "nia2",
        "nia0"
      ],
      "drb_ciphering": "yes",
      "drb_integrity": "no"
    }
  },
  "du_conf": {
    // no change required; DU networking and RFsim server are correct and will work once F1C is up
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    // no change required; UE RF matches DU. Keep rfsim client defaults
  }
}
```

If strict preference ordering is required by your deployment, place the strongest preferred algorithm first (e.g., `nea2`), but any subset of supported NEA values without `nea9` will resolve the startup failure.

Operational checklist after applying fix:
- Start CU → verify no "unknown ciphering algorithm" error; check F1/NGAP listeners.
- Start DU → verify SCTP association established and F1 Setup Response received; confirm radio activation and RFsim server listening on 4043.
- Start UE → confirm TCP connect to 4043 succeeds; observe SSB lock, RRC connection, registration.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; conclusions rely on explicit CU error and consistent refusal patterns.
- The exact OAI build behavior upon invalid security config can vary by commit; here, it evidently prevents F1C listener startup, matching the observed DU/UE symptoms.
- Specification context: 3GPP defines NEA0/1/2/3; `nea9` is nonstandard and unsupported by OAI, which aligns with the RRC error and subsequent failures.
