## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs indicate OAI NR SA mode with RF simulator: CU and DU started with `--sa` and `--rfsim`, UE attempts to connect to an RF simulator server at `127.0.0.1:4043`. Expected flow: CU initializes and validates configuration → DU initializes PHY/MAC and starts F1AP → F1-C SCTP association between DU (127.0.0.3) and CU (127.0.0.5) → once F1 is established, DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim and proceeds with cell search/SSB, PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session.

Input guidance (misconfigured_param): `gNBs.tracking_area_code=-1`.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs:
  - `tr_s_preference: "f1"`, CU F1-C listens on `local_s_address: 127.0.0.5`, DU connects from `remote_s_address: 127.0.0.3`. AMF/NGU IPs are set but irrelevant until F1 succeeds.
  - CU snippet does not show `tracking_area_code`, but CU logs explicitly flag it as `-1` and invalid.
- du_conf.gNBs[0]:
  - `tracking_area_code: 1`, PLMN `001/01`, band 78, SCS µ=1, N_RB=106, PRACH index 98, TDD config as in logs. DU F1-C connects to CU at `127.0.0.5`.
- ue_conf: IMSI/DNN only; UE RF parameters inferred from logs (frequency 3619.2 MHz, µ=1, N_RB=106). UE tries rfsim client connection to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Immediate mismatch: CU has `tracking_area_code=-1` (invalid by OAI range check 1..65533), while DU uses `1`. The CU will abort during config checks, preventing F1 setup and thus DU radio activation and rfsim server readiness.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode and starts parsing config, then:
  - `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: -1 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533`
  - `[ENB_APP] ... section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`
  - `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`

Interpretation: CU fails at configuration validation due to `tracking_area_code=-1`. CU never brings up F1AP or NGAP and exits. This guarantees DU’s F1-C SCTP connection attempts will be refused, and UE will be indirectly blocked because DU will not fully activate.

Cross-reference with cu_conf: Even though the provided CU JSON snippet omits `tracking_area_code`, the runtime CU conf (from the command line path) contains it and it is set to `-1`, triggering the failure. The valid value must be a positive TAC, commonly matching DU’s `1`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly: antenna ports, TDD, SIB1, PRACH parameters, frequencies all consistent with band 78 and µ=1.
- F1AP start and network bindings:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and `Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...`
- DU prints: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

Interpretation: Since CU exited, the F1-C endpoint at 127.0.0.5 is not listening; DU cannot establish SCTP. OAI DU holds radio activation until F1 Setup Response; thus RU/rfsim side is not fully activated to accept UE connections.

Link to DU config: DU’s `tracking_area_code` is valid (`1`). The failure is upstream (CU aborted). All other DU parameters align with logs (SSB frequency, TDD pattern, PRACH index 98) and are not the cause.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for band 78 µ=1 N_RB=106 at 3619200000 Hz, then repeatedly:
  - `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043`
  - `connect() ... failed, errno(111)`

Interpretation: UE is an rfsim client and cannot connect because the rfsim server (typically the DU) has not opened its listening socket yet. This is consistent with DU blocking radio/rfsim activation pending F1 Setup Response, which cannot arrive because CU exited due to invalid `tracking_area_code`.

Note: UE parameters are otherwise fine; the connection failure is a cascade from the CU config error.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU exits immediately on config validation error (`tracking_area_code=-1`).
  - DU repeatedly retries F1-C SCTP to CU → refused, prints it is waiting for F1 Setup Response → radio not activated → rfsim server not ready.
  - UE, acting as rfsim client, fails to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `ECONNREFUSED`.

- Root cause: Misconfigured CU `gNBs.tracking_area_code=-1` (invalid). OAI explicitly enforces 1..65533 for this field. With CU aborting, the entire chain fails: DU cannot complete F1 setup, and UE cannot connect to rfsim.

- Why TAC matters: Tracking Area Code is a core-identifying parameter broadcast in SIB and used for mobility/registration. While 3GPP defines TAC field sizing, OAI applies stricter runtime validation (rejecting non-positive or reserved values). Setting `-1` violates OAI constraints, causing early termination.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Correct the CU configuration:
  - Set `gNBs.tracking_area_code` to a valid value, e.g., `1` to match DU.
  - Ensure CU and DU PLMN/TAC match to avoid RRC/registration issues later.

- After fixing, expected behavior:
  - CU passes config checks, starts F1AP/NGAP.
  - DU establishes F1-C SCTP, receives F1 Setup Response, activates radio and rfsim server.
  - UE connects to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043, proceeds with SSB detection, PRACH, RRC, NAS registration.

- Optional validations:
  - Verify F1-C addresses: CU `127.0.0.5`, DU `127.0.0.3` are consistent in both configs and logs.
  - Keep DU’s `tracking_area_code: 1` and align CU accordingly.

Notes on the snippet:
- Added `tracking_area_code: 1` to CU `gNBs` (the only required change to fix the root cause). Other fields are shown only to keep context; keep existing values unchanged elsewhere.
- DU and UE sections included to highlight consistency; no changes required there.

Follow-up checks after applying the fix:
- Confirm CU log no longer shows `tracking_area_code` error and F1AP initializes.
- Confirm DU stops SCTP retry loop and prints F1 Setup complete; radio activation message appears.
- Confirm UE connects to rfsim, no more `ECONNREFUSED`.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; precise ordering is inferred.
- The provided CU JSON snippet omits the erroneous `tracking_area_code` field, but runtime logs prove it was present with `-1`.
- Specification references are based on OAI’s runtime validation message indicating allowed TAC range (1..65533); exact 3GPP reserved values may differ by release but do not affect the OAI-enforced constraint causing the failure here.
