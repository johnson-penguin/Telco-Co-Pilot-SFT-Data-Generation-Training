## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We are analyzing an OAI 5G NR SA setup using the RF simulator:
- CU and DU run with `--rfsim --sa` (SA mode, F1 split). UE uses `rfsimulator` and attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected call flow: CU starts and validates configuration → DU starts and connects F1 to CU → CU/DU establish F1 → DU activates radio → UE connects to RFsim server → synchronization/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.

Guiding clue (misconfigured_param): `gNBs.tracking_area_code=9999999` (CU side). This is outside OAI’s allowed range (1..65533). The CU log explicitly shows `config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 9999999 invalid value`, followed by `config_execcheck ... wrong value` and immediate exit. Therefore, we expect CU to terminate during config validation, preventing F1 and downstream procedures.

Parsing network_config quickly:
- cu_conf.gNBs:
  - `tracking_area_code`: 9,999,999 (invalid per OAI; must be 1..65533). PLMN MCC=1, MNC=1, `gNB_name` is `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
  - NGU/N2 IPs `192.168.8.43`, S1U port 2152; AMF `192.168.70.132`.
- du_conf.gNBs[0]:
  - Valid PLMN MCC=1, MNC=1. SSB center 641280 (≈3.6192 GHz), band 78, 106 PRB, PRACH idx 98, TDD pattern.
  - RFsim is configured as server on port 4043.
- ue_conf: IMSI `001010000000001`, DNN `oai`.

Initial mismatch aligned with the misconfigured_param:
- CU will exit on invalid `tracking_area_code` before opening SCTP/F1. DU will then fail to connect to CU over F1. UE will fail to connect to RFsim server because DU holds activation pending F1 setup and/or the RFsim server is not active for UE yet.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key CU lines:
- `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 9999999 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533`.
- `[ENB_APP] [CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`.
- `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.

Interpretation:
- CU parses config, fails validation due to out-of-range TAC, and exits immediately. No NGAP/AMF or GTP-U bring-up proceeds. No F1 listener is created on CU.
- This is a hard stop entirely attributable to the invalid `tracking_area_code`.

Cross-ref with cu_conf:
- JSON shows `tracking_area_code: 9999999`, matching the error. All other CU params look reasonable; the TAC alone causes the CU termination.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
DU initialization:
- PHY/MAC and serving cell config are healthy: µ=1, 106 PRB, SSB freq 641280, PRACH index 98, TDD configuration, antennas set.
- DU attempts F1 connection to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated errors: `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused`, `Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...`, and `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

Interpretation:
- Because CU has already exited, the DU cannot establish SCTP/F1. DU remains in a waiting/retry loop and does not activate the radio without an F1 Setup Response. This blocks RFsim server activation for UE.

Link to network_config params:
- DU `servingCellConfigCommon` (PRACH/TDD/etc.) is consistent; no PHY/MAC misconfiguration indicated. The only blocking dependency is F1 connectivity to the CU.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
UE behavior:
- UE config matches gNB numerology: µ=1, 106 PRB, DL/UL 3.6192 GHz. It repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Repeated `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` shows connection refused.

Interpretation:
- RFsim server-side (DU) is not accepting connections, likely because the DU has not activated radio pending F1 Setup Response from CU. Since CU exited, UE cannot reach the server and loops on connection attempts.

Link to network_config:
- DU `rfsimulator.serveraddr` is `server` (DU acts as server on 4043). UE tries to connect as client to 127.0.0.1:4043. Without DU activation, the socket isn’t accepting.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline:
- CU fails config validation due to invalid `tracking_area_code` (out of range), exits.
- DU continues startup but cannot establish F1 (SCTP refused) because CU is down; DU idles awaiting F1 Setup Response, radio not activated.
- UE cannot connect to RFsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043; connection refused in a loop.

Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param):
- The invalid CU `tracking_area_code=9999999` violates OAI range checks (1..65533), causing the CU to terminate during configuration execution checks. This prevents F1 establishment and DU/UE progression. No other PHY or PRACH issues are implicated.

Standards and OAI behavior context:
- TAC is part of tracking area identification for mobility management in 5GC/NGAP context. While 3GPP encodings vary, OAI enforces implementation bounds; exceeding them results in early termination. This is consistent with the CU’s `config_check_intrange` error and immediate exit.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration fix:
- Set CU `tracking_area_code` to a valid value within 1..65533 (e.g., 1). Keep DU TAC aligned (already 1). Then restart CU → DU → UE.

Validation steps:
- After fix, verify CU completes initialization (no config errors), starts F1 listener.
- DU should connect F1 successfully; look for F1 Setup Request/Response and DU radio activation.
- UE should connect to RFsim server (127.0.0.1:4043), detect SSB, perform PRACH, and proceed with RRC.

```

Further analysis (optional):
- Increase CU log verbosity (`f1ap_log_level`, `ngap_log_level`, `rrc_log_level`) if any residual F1/NGAP issues persist post-fix.
- Confirm SCTP connectivity (ports, loopback addresses) matches CU/DU configs.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; only one explicit CU configuration error is shown, which is sufficient to explain the cascade. Other potential issues (e.g., PRACH/SIB specifics) are not engaged because the system fails before F1 setup.
- The RFsim connection failures at the UE are a downstream symptom; once CU TAC is corrected and CU remains up, DU/UE behavior should progress to the physical layer and RA, where separate tuning (if required) would be addressed.
