## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The run is 5G NR Standalone using OAI with RF simulator: CU log shows nr-softmodem launched with `--rfsim --sa -O cu_case_103.conf`. DU log shows SA mode and RF simulator context, and UE log runs the RF simulator client trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected call flow: process configs → start CU (NGAP off-path in this setup), start DU → establish F1-C (SCTP) between DU (127.0.0.3) and CU (127.0.0.5) → DU activates radio and RF simulator server → UE connects to RF simulator server → SSB search, PRACH, RRC connection, etc.
- The provided misconfigured parameter is: gNBs.gNB_name=None (in CU). CU logs confirm a config syntax error and failure to initialize the config module. DU and UE subsequently stall because CU is down.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- cu_conf:
  - `Active_gNBs`: ["gNB-Eurecom-CU"].
  - `gNBs` is an object (not an array) and has no `gNB_name`; misconfigured parameter indicates it was set to None. CU expects a valid `gNB_name` string and typically an array of gNB objects.
  - F1 addresses: CU local 127.0.0.5, DU remote 127.0.0.3. Matches DU side (see below).
- du_conf:
  - `Active_gNBs`: ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"].
  - `gNBs` is an array and includes `gNB_name: gNB-Eurecom-DU` and full cell config. F1 DU IP 127.0.0.3 connects to CU 127.0.0.5.
  - rfsimulator: `serveraddr: "server"`, `serverport: 4043` (DU should host the RF sim server once radio is activated).
- ue_conf: IMSI and DNN present; RF frequencies align with DU SSB absolute frequency (3619200000 Hz derived from 641280 ARFCN at band n78).

Immediate mismatch: CU `gNBs` structure/contents are invalid (missing `gNB_name` and wrong shape), consistent with libconfig syntax error and CU abort. This explains downstream DU/UE symptoms.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Key lines:
  - "[LIBCONFIG] ... line 15: syntax error"
  - "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded" and multiple "config module not properly initialized"
  - "[LOG] init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed"
  - Command line shows `--rfsim --sa -O .../cu_case_103.conf`.
- Interpretation:
  - CU failed at config parsing stage. In OAI, `gNBs` must have a valid schema. Setting `gNBs.gNB_name=None` results in a parse/type error (and often the CU schema expects `gNBs` as an array with objects that include `gNB_name`).
  - Because CU aborted, no F1-C listener is active on 127.0.0.5.
- Cross-ref with cu_conf:
  - `tr_s_preference: f1` and F1 addresses configured correctly. The only blocker shown is the config syntax/type error, tied to the misconfigured parameter.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- Initialization proceeds through PHY/MAC and RRC common config, including TDD pattern, band/numerology, and SIB1 details.
- F1AP start: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5".
- Repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" followed by F1AP retry messages.
- "[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" appears, so DU does not activate the radio nor start the RF sim server path.
- Interpretation:
  - DU is healthy but cannot reach CU because CU is down from config failure. As designed, DU holds radio activation (and thereby RF simulator availability) until F1 setup completes.
  - No PRACH/MAC errors appear; the failure is upstream at F1 connectivity.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes successfully for DL 3619200000 Hz, mu=1, N_RB=106, TDD, and spins up threads.
- Critically, it attempts to connect as an RF simulator client to 127.0.0.1:4043 and repeatedly fails with errno(111) (connection refused).
- Interpretation:
  - In this OAI RF sim topology, the DU acts as server (`serveraddr: "server"`) and should listen on 4043. However, DU defers bringing up the server until after F1 Setup Response. Since CU is down, DU never activates radio/server; thus UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU: Config parse error → CU aborts; no F1 endpoint at 127.0.0.5.
  - DU: Repeated SCTP connection refused when trying to connect to CU → waits for F1 Setup Response → radio not activated → RF sim server not listening.
  - UE: Repeated connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 refused because no RF sim server up.
- Root cause anchored in misconfigured_param:
  - `gNBs.gNB_name=None` inside CU config causes a schema/type violation and libconfig parse error. Additionally, CU’s `gNBs` object shape deviates from OAI’s current JSON schema (should be an array of gNB objects). Either is sufficient to break parsing; combined, they guarantee failure.
- Supporting knowledge:
  - OAI CU/DU JSON expects `gNBs` as an array. Each gNB entry must include `gNB_name` (string). libconfig errors at early lines typically indicate structural/type issues.
  - F1 activation gating radio bring-up is standard in OAI’s DU logic; without F1 Setup, DU won’t start RF server for UE.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix the CU configuration:
  - Provide a valid `gNB_name` string (e.g., "gNB-Eurecom-CU").
  - Conform `gNBs` to an array of objects; move the existing CU gNB fields into the object and add `gNB_name`.
  - Keep F1 addresses consistent with DU.
- After the fix:
  - Start CU first, confirm no libconfig errors.
  - Start DU, verify F1 Setup completes and DU logs "activating radio"; RF sim server should listen on 4043.
  - Start UE; connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 should succeed, followed by SSB/PRACH and RRC procedures.
- Optional validations:
  - Check that `Active_gNBs` matches the `gNB_name` string.
  - Ensure no trailing commas or type mismatches in CU JSON.
  - Confirm host firewall allows local TCP connections on 4043 if not purely in-process.

UE and DU configs appear coherent for this topology. No change is strictly required, but for completeness ensure DU’s RF simulator remains server-side and UE points to 127.0.0.1:4043:

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "server", // DU is RF sim server
      "serverport": 4043,
      "options": [],
      "modelname": "AWGN",
      "IQfile": "/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs"
    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", // UE connects to local DU server
      "serverport": 4043
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. Limitations

- CU log shows only the config failure; the exact offending line is not enumerated beyond a line number, but the provided misconfigured parameter and the absence of `gNB_name` in CU JSON explain the failure.
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; correlation relies on typical OAI sequencing and messages (F1 gating, RF simulator bring-up order).
- The JSON schema in different OAI versions can evolve; the recommendation follows the commonly used array-of-`gNBs` structure that aligns with DU’s shape and avoids the `None` type error.
