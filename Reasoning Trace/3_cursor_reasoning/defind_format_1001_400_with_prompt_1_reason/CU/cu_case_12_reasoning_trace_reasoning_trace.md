## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OpenAirInterface 5G NR Standalone using rfsimulator. CU and DU logs both state SA mode. Expected flow: CU initializes, connects to AMF via NGAP; DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU, establishes F1-C SCTP to CU; once F1 is up, DU activates radio and starts rfsimulator server; UE connects to rfsimulator, performs PRACH and RRC attach leading to PDU session.

Provided misconfigured_param: gNBs.tr_s_preference=123. In OAI, tr_s_preference selects the southbound transport between MAC/RLC and L1/RU (e.g., "local_L1", "fhi_72"). A value of 123 is invalid and can prevent proper MAC↔L1 binding or change activation order.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs: NGAP and GTP-U bind to 192.168.8.43; AMF IPv4 192.168.70.132. CU is pure-CU: RC.nb_nr_L1_inst=0 in logs, as expected.
- du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0]: n78, 106 PRBs, SCS µ=1, PRACH idx 98, ssb periodicity 20 ms, TDD pattern DL-heavy (8 DL, 3 UL slots per 10-slot period). RF band and numerology align with UE logs (3619.2 MHz DL/UL, µ=1).
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0]: tr_s_preference shows "local_L1" in the JSON, but the error case declares misconfigured_param as 123. Assume the error run used 123, creating a MAC↔L1 transport mismatch.
- ue_conf: standard test IMSI/K/OPC; frequencies align with DU.

Initial mismatch: DU logs show repeated F1 SCTP connect refused to CU. UE logs show repeated connection failures to rfsimulator 127.0.0.1:4043. This implies DU did not activate radio/start rfsim server because F1 setup did not complete. The misconfigured tr_s_preference plausibly prevents DU MAC/L1 activation gating needed for F1 or radio bring-up.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU initializes SA, spawns NGAP/RRC/GTPU threads, registers gNB, and successfully completes NGSetup with AMF. GTP-U configured on 192.168.8.43:2152. No CU-side errors or F1AP server logs are printed, but CU in split mode should listen for F1-C on 127.0.0.5 per config.
- Nothing indicates a crash; CU appears healthy and waiting for DU F1 Setup Request.

Cross-check with cu_conf:
- F1-C endpoints: cu_conf.gNBs.local_s_address 127.0.0.5, remote_s_address 127.0.0.3; DU’s F1-C client matches these in DU logs. NGAP addresses match CU logs.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY and MAC, reads ServingCellConfigCommon, configures TDD, computes RF frequencies, and prints antenna setup. It then starts F1AP and attempts SCTP connect to CU at 127.0.0.5, but receives repeated Connection refused.
- DU prints "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" and does not activate RU/rfsimulator.
- No PRACH or PHY assertion errors are present; the block is at F1 establishment/activation ordering.

Link to config:
- du_conf.MACRLCs[0].tr_s_preference should be a symbolic string like "local_L1" (software stack) or alternatives (e.g., "fhi_72" for O-RU front-haul). A numeric value (123) is invalid, likely causing the MAC/RLC→L1 transport to be uninitialized or defaulted inconsistently, which can alter when radio activation occurs and whether the F1 task is considered ready.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with µ=1, N_RB=106 at 3619.2 MHz. It runs as rfsimulator client and repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, getting errno 111 (connection refused). This means the rfsimulator server on the DU side was never started.
- In OAI rfsim, the DU typically starts the server on 4043; UE connects as client. Because DU is waiting for F1 Setup Response before radio activation, the rfsim server is not up, hence UE connection failures.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU is up and connected to AMF; DU cannot complete F1 SCTP to CU (connection refused). Without F1, DU does not activate radio; thus rfsim server is not started. UE cannot connect to rfsim server and loops on connect() failures.
- Why is SCTP refused? CU should listen on 127.0.0.5 for F1-C. A typical cause is that the CU’s F1 task is not started or bound yet when DU attempts. With misconfigured tr_s_preference=123 on the DU (or placed under the wrong section, as the misconfigured_param path suggests), DU’s internal initialization state machine for MAC/L1 and F1 can be affected. OAI ties activation of radio and certain inter-task readiness to transport selections. An invalid tr_s_preference can:
  - Fail MAC↔L1 binding, leaving DU not fully ready, impacting F1 setup timing/behavior.
  - Cause CU/DU role expectations mismatch if parsed incorrectly, preventing CU F1 server init or delaying it.

Therefore, the root cause is the invalid transport selection value gNBs.tr_s_preference=123 leading to improper MAC/L1 transport configuration. Consequences cascade: DU waits for F1 response → radio not activated → rfsim server not started → UE cannot connect; concurrently, DU’s F1 connect hits refusal (server not ready on CU), consistent with initialization order disruption.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix:
- Set tr_s_preference to a valid value matching the intended transport. For standard rfsimulator DU, use "local_L1". Ensure the parameter is under the correct section (`MACRLCs`) and not mistakenly under `gNBs`.

Corrected snippets (only changed fields shown):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "MACRLCs": [
        {
          "num_cc": 1,
          "tr_s_preference": "local_L1", // corrected from 123; must be a valid string
          "tr_n_preference": "f1",
          "local_n_address": "127.0.0.3",
          "remote_n_address": "127.0.0.5",
          "local_n_portc": 500,
          "local_n_portd": 2152,
          "remote_n_portc": 501,
          "remote_n_portd": 2152
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If the erroneous parameter was placed under `gNBs` as indicated by misconfigured_param, remove it there entirely; `gNBs.tr_s_preference` is not a valid path in current OAI JSON schemas.

Post-fix validation steps:
- Restart CU first; confirm it binds F1-C server on 127.0.0.5.
- Start DU; verify F1 SCTP connects and F1 Setup completes; check that DU logs proceed to radio activation and that rfsimulator server starts.
- Start UE; confirm successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session.
- If F1 still refuses, confirm CU `local_s_address` is reachable and not bound to a different interface, and that no firewall blocks SCTP on localhost.

Further analysis if issues persist:
- Increase `f1ap_log_level` and `mac_log_level` to debug on both CU and DU.
- Verify CU actually starts the F1 task in this split deployment; ensure CU’s config matches DU’s `local_n_/remote_n_` endpoints.
- Confirm valid tr_s_preference values for your OAI version (e.g., "local_L1", "fhi_72").

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; CU F1 server readiness is inferred from absence/presence of logs and DU behavior.
- The provided du_conf shows "local_L1", but the misconfigured_param specifies 123; analysis assumes the error run used the invalid value or wrong JSON path, causing the observed symptoms.
- PRACH parameters appear sane (index 98 for µ=1), so PRACH itself is not the blocker here.
