## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI NR SA with RFsim based on logs showing "--rfsim --sa". Expected bring-up: CU and DU start → F1 setup between CU and DU → CU connects to AMF over NGAP → DU activates radio → UE connects to RFsim server → cell search/SSB sync → PRACH → RRC setup → PDU session. The provided misconfigured_param is gNBs.plmn_list.mnc_length=-1. This directly impacts PLMN encoding/validation at the CU.

From network_config:
- CU `gNBs.plmn_list` has `mcc=1`, `mnc=1` but no explicit `mnc_length`. Logs show CU validates `mnc_length` and finds -1, which is invalid; valid values are 2 or 3.
- DU `plmn_list[0]` has `mcc=1`, `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2` (valid).
- DU serves Band 78, FR1, SCS µ=1, BW 106 PRBs, `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280` → 3619200000 Hz. PRACH config index 98 etc. Nothing PHY-fatal in DU logs.
- UE defaults align with DL 3619200000 Hz, RFsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Immediate mismatch: CU rejects config due to invalid `mnc_length=-1` and exits. This prevents F1 setup; DU repeatedly retries SCTP; UE cannot connect to RFsim server (no gNB RFsim server active) and loops with errno(111).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA with RFsim; prints build info.
- RAN Context shows zero MAC/RLC/L1 instances because CU role is control only, consistent with F1 split.
- Critical lines:
  - "[CONFIG] config_check_intval: mnc_length: -1 invalid value, authorized values: 2 3"
  - "[ENB_APP][CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value"
  - "config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun"

Interpretation: The CU's libconfig validation failed on `plmn_list.mnc_length`. OAI treats `mnc_length` as mandatory (2 or 3) to correctly encode PLMN in SIBs/NG setup. As a result, CU terminates before starting SCTP servers and before F1-C endpoint is reachable. NGAP/AMF details in config are irrelevant because CU never reaches that stage.

Cross-ref with CU `gnb_conf`: `NETWORK_INTERFACES` and AMF IPs look plausible, but they are not exercised due to early exit. The root cause is strictly the PLMN config check.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU brings up PHY/MAC and RRC common config correctly for n78 µ=1, BW 106, confirms TDD pattern and frequency mapping.
- DU starts F1AP as client, targets CU at 127.0.0.5 (matches CU `local_s_address`).
- Repeated errors:
  - "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused"
  - "[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying..."
- Also: "[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" → DU explicitly gates radio activation until F1 SETUP completes.

Interpretation: Because CU exited on config error, the F1-C server port on 127.0.0.5 is closed. DU correctly keeps retrying SCTP and never transitions to active cell state. No PRACH or runtime PHY errors; stall is caused by missing CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with µ=1, BW 106 at 3619200000 Hz, matching DU plan.
- UE runs as RFsim client, trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Repeated: "connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)" (connection refused).

Interpretation: In OAI RFsim, the gNB side typically hosts the RFsim server. Since DU never activates radio (waiting for F1 setup) and CU is down, the RFsim server is not running/accepting connections. UE therefore loops on connection attempts and never proceeds to cell search/SSB sync.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Misconfigured parameter provided: `gNBs.plmn_list.mnc_length=-1`.
- CU logs confirm immediate termination due to invalid `mnc_length` (allowed values 2 or 3). This blocks F1 setup entirely.
- DU is healthy up to F1 initiation but cannot connect, repeatedly refused by nonexistent CU F1-C endpoint.
- UE cannot connect to RFsim server because DU does not activate radio without F1 setup.

Root Cause: Invalid PLMN configuration at CU (`mnc_length=-1`) violates OAI config validation, causing CU to exit early. Cascading effects: DU F1 setup fails; RF path not activated; UE RFsim client cannot connect.

External standards context (no lookup required): 3GPP PLMN identities encode MCC (3 digits) and MNC (2 or 3 digits). OAI requires explicit `mnc_length` to disambiguate two-digit MNCs; values must be 2 or 3. A negative value is invalid and rejected by config checks.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix: Set `mnc_length` to a valid value (2 or 3) matching the configured MNC. Given `mnc=1` is effectively two-digit (01) in many test configs, choose `mnc_length=2` to align with DU.

After fix, expected sequence: CU starts and serves F1-C → DU completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio and RFsim server → UE RFsim client connects → SSB detection/PRACH proceed → RRC setup.

Additional checks after fix:
- Ensure CU and DU PLMN entries match exactly (`mcc`, `mnc`, and `mnc_length`).
- Verify F1-C addresses: CU `local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, DU connects to 127.0.0.5; OK.
- Confirm RFsim server/client roles: DU should host server per config; UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043; OK once DU active.

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON with explanatory comments):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "plmn_list": {
          "mcc": 1,
          "mnc": 1,
          "mnc_length": 2 // FIX: set to a valid value (2 to match DU)
        }
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "plmn_list": [
            {
              "mcc": 1,
              "mnc": 1,
              "mnc_length": 2 // unchanged; already valid and consistent
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // no change needed for this issue; UE RFsim failures are secondary
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update CU config and restart CU first; verify CU remains up without config_execcheck exit.
- Start DU; confirm F1 Setup completes and DU logs "activating radio".
- Start UE; connection to RFsim server should succeed; observe SSB/PRACH and RRC.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; analysis assumes typical OAI sequencing.
- The JSON includes only key sections; full CU config file not shown, but the error line unambiguously identifies `mnc_length`.
- No need for external spec/tool lookup given direct validation message; if uncertainty remained, one would consult 3GPP TS 23.003 (PLMN coding) and OAI config checks to confirm valid ranges for `mnc_length` (2 or 3).
