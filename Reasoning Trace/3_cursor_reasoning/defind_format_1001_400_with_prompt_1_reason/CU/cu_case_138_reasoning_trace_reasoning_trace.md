\n## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
OAI 5G NR Standalone with rfsimulator. Expected sequence: CU validates config, starts F1-C server and NGAP to AMF → DU initializes PHY/MAC and connects to CU over F1-C → after F1 Setup, DU activates radio and starts the rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server, does PRACH and RRC attach, then PDU session.

Misconfigured parameter: security.ciphering_algorithms[1]= (empty). Valid NR ciphering algorithms per 3GPP TS 33.501 and OAI are "nea2", "nea1", and "nea0" (plus optionally "nea3" in OAI). An empty string is invalid. OAI validates the configured list; encountering an unknown/empty algorithm triggers an error at CU startup in the security/RRC init path.

Network config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs: F1-C server on 127.0.0.5 with DU peer 127.0.0.3; NGAP/GTU bind 192.168.8.43; tr_s_preference "f1" appropriate for CU-CP.
- cu_conf.security.ciphering_algorithms: ["nea3", "", "nea1", "nea0"] → the second entry is empty and invalid.
- du_conf: n78, µ=1, N_RB=106, PRACH idx 98; MACRLC uses "local_L1"; rfsimulator server port 4043.
- ue_conf: standard test IMSI/K/OPC; UE numerology/frequency match DU.

Initial mismatch with misconfigured_param: CU logs report unknown ciphering algorithm "" at startup, aligning exactly with the empty entry at index 1. Downstream, DU faces F1 SCTP refusals; UE cannot connect to rfsim—both consistent with CU failing to fully initialize and not binding F1.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU enters SA mode, prints gNB init lines, then: unknown ciphering algorithm "" in section "security". Following lines only show config section reads; there are no NGAP successes or F1 server readiness logs.
- Even though the first ciphering entry ("nea3") is valid, OAI’s parser aborts on encountering an invalid entry in the list. Thus the RRC/security init fails and prevents F1 server startup.

Cross-reference with cu_conf:
- The empty string at security.ciphering_algorithms[1] exactly matches the error. Replace/remove it.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU completes PHY/MAC init, configures TDD and frequencies, then starts F1AP client to 127.0.0.5.
- Repeated SCTP connect failures (Connection refused) show CU’s F1 server is not listening due to the earlier error.
- DU remains waiting for F1 Setup Response; radio is not activated; rfsim server is not started.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for µ=1, N_RB=106 at 3619.2 MHz, then repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 with errno(111) (connection refused).
- Since DU never completed F1 and didn’t activate radio, the rfsim server never started; hence UE TCP failures.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Root cause: CU misconfiguration—empty ciphering algorithm entry at security.ciphering_algorithms[1]. CU aborts security/RRC init; F1-C server isn’t started.
- Consequences: DU’s SCTP to F1-C refused → F1 Setup never completes → DU radio off and rfsim server not started → UE TCP to 127.0.0.1:4043 refused.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration fix (CU):
- Remove the empty entry and use only valid algorithms, ordered by preference. Recommended: ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"] or simply ["nea2", "nea1", "nea0"]. Integrity list can remain ["nia2", "nia0"] or include "nia1" if desired.

Corrected snippet (only changed fields shown):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"], // removed empty string at index 1
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Validation steps after fix:
- Start CU; verify no "unknown ciphering algorithm" error and that F1AP server binds on 127.0.0.5; NGSetup with AMF proceeds.
- Start DU; confirm SCTP association and F1 Setup; DU activates radio and starts rfsim server.
- Start UE; verify TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session establishment.

If problems persist:
- Raise CU/DU log levels for RRC/F1AP/security. Ensure no other invalid entries in `security`.
- Confirm algorithm overlap with UE stack (NEA2/NIA2 widely supported).
- Ensure localhost SCTP and TCP ports are not blocked or occupied by other processes.

## 7. Limitations
- CU logs are truncated; inference of missing F1 server is from DU’s refusals and the early security error.
- UE never progresses to RRC; analysis focuses on upstream blocking.
- Assumes OAI enforces strict validation of all entries in ciphering list; behavior matches the observed error log.
