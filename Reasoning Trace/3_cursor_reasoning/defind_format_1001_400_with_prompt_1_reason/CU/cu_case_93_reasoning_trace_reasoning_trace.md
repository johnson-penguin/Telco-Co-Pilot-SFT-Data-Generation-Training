## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

We are analyzing an OAI 5G NR Standalone setup using the RF simulator. The expected bring-up sequence is: start CU (NGAP/F1-C readiness) → start DU (F1-C association to CU; activate RU/rfsim server after F1-Setup) → start UE (connect to rfsim server; sync via SSB; perform PRACH; RRC attach; PDU session).

Guiding clue from misconfigured_param: "log_config.rlc_log_level=None". In OAI, log levels are defined as symbolic strings (e.g., "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace"), and an invalid token such as "None" leads libconfig to a parse error or a validation failure. CU logs indeed show a libconfig parse error and abort. That prevents F1-Setup, which in turn blocks DU radio activation and the rfsimulator server socket, causing UE connection attempts to fail.

Network configuration summary (extracted):
- CU `gNB_name` "gNB-Eurecom-CU", F1-C on loopback: CU `local_s_address` 127.0.0.5, DU peer `remote_s_address` 127.0.0.3; ports align (CU `local_s_portc` 501 / DU `remote_n_portc` 501, DU `local_n_portc` 500 / CU `remote_s_portc` 500). AMF on `192.168.70.132`. CU `log_config` does not list `rlc_log_level`, consistent with the sanitized JSON here, but the error case references a bad value at runtime.
- DU config: SA, band n78, SCS 30 kHz, BW 106 PRBs, SSB ARFCN 641280 (~3619.2 MHz). F1-C target CU 127.0.0.5. TDD pattern provided. `rfsimulator.serveraddr` set to symbolic "server" (DU acts as server on port 4043). Radio activation is gated on F1-Setup.
- UE config: SIM credentials only; by logs, RF is TDD on 3619.2 MHz and the UE tries to connect to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043 as client.

Immediate mismatch/concern: The misconfigured CU parameter `log_config.rlc_log_level=None` (not visible in the provided cleaned JSON, but present in the failing CU file) triggers config parse failure, halting CU initialization. Consequently, DU cannot complete F1-Setup (SCTP connect refused), so it does not activate radio nor start the rfsim server listener, and the UE’s repeated TCP connects to 127.0.0.1:4043 fail (ECONNREFUSED).

Assumption: RF simulator end-to-end over loopback; normal flow is CU ready first, then DU establishes F1-C, then DU starts rfsim server, then UE connects.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Key lines:
- "[LIBCONFIG] ... cu_case_92.conf - line 86: syntax error"
- "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded"
- "config_get, section log_config skipped, config module not properly initialized"
- "[LOG] init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed"
- Command line shows `--rfsim --sa -O .../cu_case_92.conf`.

Interpretation:
- The CU fails during early configuration parsing. In OAI, a malformed `log_config` entry (such as an invalid enum token) can cause a libconfig parse error. The misconfigured parameter matches: `log_config.rlc_log_level=None` is not a valid level and would yield a parser or semantic error. Because the config module cannot be initialized, CU aborts before NGAP and F1AP are brought up.
- Cross-reference to `network_config.cu_conf`: the cleaned JSON lacks `rlc_log_level`, but the runtime error originates from the error-case file `cu_case_92.conf`. Therefore, the root cause is in the CU config, not in connectivity.

CU impact on others:
- With CU down, the F1-C association point at 127.0.0.5:500/501 is unavailable, so any DU connect attempt will be refused.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Key lines and flow:
- SA mode init; PHY/MAC/RRC parameters consistent with n78@3619.2 MHz, SCS 30 kHz, BW 106 PRB.
- F1AP start: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5".
- Repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and F1AP retrying.
- "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" remains pending.

Interpretation:
- DU starts but cannot establish F1-C because the CU is not listening due to its config abort. The DU explicitly waits for F1-Setup Response before activating radio and therefore does not bring up the rfsimulator server socket on 4043 in practice.
- No PHY/MAC asserts about PRACH or TDD; the failure is purely control-plane connectivity (F1-C) blocked by CU unavailability.

Link to gNB params:
- IP/ports align with CU config (loopback pair 127.0.0.3 ↔ 127.0.0.5). This corroborates that the issue is not addressing but CU readiness.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Key lines:
- UE RF setup matches gNB: SCS 30 kHz, DL freq 3619200000 Hz, N_RB 106.
- Repeated attempts: "Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043" → "connect() ... failed, errno(111)".

Interpretation:
- UE operates as rfsimulator client; expects the gNB (DU) to listen on localhost:4043. Because the DU is waiting for F1-Setup and has not activated radio, the rfsimulator server is not listening. Hence ECONNREFUSED loops.
- This is a secondary symptom of the CU failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU aborts at configuration parsing due to invalid `log_config` parameter (`rlc_log_level=None`).
- DU cannot connect F1-C; it continuously retries SCTP and remains in a pre-activation state.
- Without F1-Setup Response, DU does not activate the RU nor the rfsimulator server, leaving port 4043 closed.
- UE, acting as client to 127.0.0.1:4043, fails to connect repeatedly.

Root cause:
- Misconfigured CU parameter `log_config.rlc_log_level=None` is invalid for OAI’s libconfig schema. Acceptable values are typical log levels like "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace". Setting it to "None" (Pythonic literal) yields a config parse error, aborting CU.

Supporting evidence:
- CU log shows direct libconfig syntax error and module initialization failure. DU shows SCTP connect refused (no listener on CU). UE shows ECONNREFUSED to rfsim server (DU not activated). All causally follow.

Spec/code knowledge (no external lookup needed):
- OAI uses libconfig with strict token sets for log levels across subsystems (RLC included). Invalid tokens cause parse errors early.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Primary fix:
- Correct the CU configuration: replace `log_config.rlc_log_level=None` with a valid level, e.g., `"info"` (or match your desired verbosity). Ensure the entry exists under `log_config` and uses a supported string.

Bring-up sequencing:
- Start CU first (verify NGAP binds, ensure F1-C listener up), then start DU (observe successful F1-Setup and radio activation), then start UE (rfsimulator client connects successfully).

Validation steps after fix:
- CU logs: no libconfig parse error; F1AP listening; NGAP up.
- DU logs: SCTP connects, F1-Setup completes; message: "Received F1 Setup Response", then "activating radio"; rfsim server socket bound to 4043.
- UE logs: TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds; SSB detection, PRACH, RRC connection, attach.

Optional alignment checks:
- If desired, set DU `rfsimulator.serveraddr` explicitly to "127.0.0.1" (the symbolic "server" is acceptable in OAI to mean server mode, but using the explicit address can simplify audits), and ensure UE points to the same IP/port. However, this is not the root cause here.

Corrected configuration snippets (JSON-form, explanatory comments inline):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        "global_log_level": "info",
        "hw_log_level": "info",
        "phy_log_level": "info",
        "mac_log_level": "info",
        "pdcp_log_level": "info",
        "rrc_log_level": "info",
        "ngap_log_level": "info",
        "f1ap_log_level": "info",
        "rlc_log_level": "info"  
        
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server",
        "serverport": 4043,
        "options": [],
        "modelname": "AWGN",
        "IQfile": "/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `rlc_log_level` set to a valid string ("info"). Any supported level is acceptable; avoid Python literals like `None`.
- DU `rfsimulator` retained as server mode; no change required for root cause. If you prefer explicit addressing, use `"127.0.0.1"` for `serveraddr` consistently with UE expectations.

Further analysis if issues persist:
- If CU still fails, verify the offending line number in the actual `.conf` and check for stray commas or invalid tokens near `log_config`.
- Confirm F1-C endpoints: CU listens on 127.0.0.5 and DU targets that IP/ports 500/501.
- Ensure start order and that only one DU instance binds 4043.

## 7. Limitations

- The provided `cu_conf` JSON is sanitized and does not include the erroneous `rlc_log_level` key/value; the failure stems from the separate runtime file (`cu_case_92.conf`) referenced by logs. The reasoning assumes parity between sanitized JSON and the actual file except for the misconfigured parameter.
- Logs are partially truncated and lack timestamps; exact ordering between DU and UE startups is inferred from standard OAI behavior.
- No external spec lookup was required; if needed, consult OAI documentation for valid log levels and libconfig syntax.
