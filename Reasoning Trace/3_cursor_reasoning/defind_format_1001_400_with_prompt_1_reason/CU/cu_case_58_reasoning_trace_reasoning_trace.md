## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
Based on logs and config, this is an OAI NR SA rfsimulator setup: CU and DU split (F1), UE connects over `rfsimulator`. Expected flow: process configs → initialize CU and DU → F1-C association (DU→CU) → DU activates radio → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB detect/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session. The input highlights a targeted misconfiguration: **misconfigured_param = `security.ciphering_algorithms[0]=nea9`** in `cu_conf`.

- Key network parameters parsed:
  - **CU (`cu_conf.gNBs`)**: `tr_s_preference: "f1"`, `local_s_address: 127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address: 127.0.0.3`. `amf_ip_address.ipv4: 192.168.70.132`. NG/NGU IFs on `192.168.8.43`. Security: `ciphering_algorithms: [nea9, nea2, nea1, nea0]`, `integrity_algorithms: [nia2, nia0]`, `drb_ciphering: yes`, `drb_integrity: no`.
  - **DU (`du_conf`)**: F1 towards CU `remote_n_address: 127.0.0.5`, local `127.0.0.3`. RF sim server: `serveraddr: "server"`, `serverport: 4043`. NR numerology μ=1, `N_RB=106`, band n78, TDD config with 8 DL / 3 UL per 10-slot period. PRACH: `prach_ConfigurationIndex: 98`, `zeroCorrelationZoneConfig: 13`, root seq PR=2, etc.
  - **UE (`ue_conf`)**: IMSI `001010000000001`, dnn `oai`.

Initial mismatch spotted immediately in CU logs: RRC complains about an unknown ciphering algorithm `nea9`. OAI supports `nea0/1/2/3` (per 3GPP), so `nea9` is invalid.

Implication: CU security config parsing fails early; CU likely does not bring up the F1-C SCTP listener, causing DU F1 connection attempts to be refused and the DU to keep radio deactivated. UE then cannot connect to the rfsimulator server.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts SA; version stamp present.
- `GNB_APP` initializes CU-only context (`MAC/RL1/RU = 0`).
- `GNB_APP` shows DRB count 1, SDAP disabled.
- Critical error:
  - `[RRC]   unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9" in section "security" of the configuration file`.
- Following config readouts, there is no evidence of F1/NGAP activation; consistent with aborting after config validation error.
- Cross-check with `cu_conf.security.ciphering_algorithms[0] = "nea9"`: matches the error.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/TDD properly; config matches `du_conf` (μ=1, N_RB=106, n78, SIB/TDD values consistent).
- DU starts F1AP as a client to CU: `127.0.0.3 -> 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with retries.
- DU states `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` and remains stalled; therefore rfsim server is not accepting connections.
- No PRACH/PHY errors; the block is F1C connection refused (CU not listening due to config error).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE RF parameters align with DU (3619 MHz, μ=1, 106 PRBs, TDD); threads start.
- UE, as rfsim client, repeatedly fails to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- This is a downstream effect of DU not activating the radio/rfsim server because F1 setup with CU never completes.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence correlation:
  - CU security parsing fails on `nea9` → CU does not open F1-C SCTP listener.
  - DU cannot establish F1C (`ECONNREFUSED`) → DU holds radio deactivation awaiting F1 Setup Response.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server (`127.0.0.1:4043` refused) → no radio service available.
- Root cause: invalid ciphering algorithm in CU `security.ciphering_algorithms` list; OAI expects algorithms among `nea0`, `nea1`, `nea2`, `nea3`.
- Standards and OAI context: 3GPP defines EEA/NEA algorithms; OAI exposes a whitelist and rejects unknown strings during config parsing. An invalid first-preference algorithm is sufficient to fail validation.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix: replace `nea9` with a valid NEA algorithm. Typical preference in OAI test setups is `nea3` (ZUC), then `nea2` (AES), then `nea1` (SNOW3G), and optionally `nea0` (no ciphering) last.

- Minimal corrected snippets:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Expected outcome after fix:
  1) CU passes security config validation and opens F1-C SCTP listener; 2) DU completes F1 Setup, activates radio and rfsim server; 3) UE connects to `127.0.0.1:4043`, proceeds to SSB/PRACH; 4) RRC connection and PDU session setup proceed normally.

- Further validation steps:
  - Restart CU; confirm absence of the `unknown ciphering algorithm` error.
  - Check DU for `F1 Setup Response` and radio activation logs.
  - Ensure UE stops `errno(111)` and begins synchronization.
  - Optionally enable higher ASN.1 verbosity at CU to trace RRC after fix.
  - Verify PDCP selects the highest common NEA with UE during Security Mode Command/Complete.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; ordering inferred from OAI boot flow.
- Only CU shows the explicit error; assumption is CU halts F1C listener on config validation failure, consistent with DU `ECONNREFUSED`.
- UE logs only show rfsim connection attempts; deeper RRC/PDCP not visible until DU/CU come up.
- Algorithm support set is assumed per 3GPP and OAI implementation (`nea0/1/2/3`); the error line confirms `nea9` is not supported.
