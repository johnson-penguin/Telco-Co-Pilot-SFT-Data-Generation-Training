## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- OAI NR SA with rfsimulator: CU/DU start in SA mode; DU would host rfsim on 4043; UE tries TCP to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU initializes (selects active gNB by name) → NGAP/F1-C up → DU completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio and starts rfsim → UE connects, syncs SSB, PRACH, RRC/NAS.
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_name=` (empty) in CU while `Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"]` requires a matching non-empty name. This can cause CU to fail selecting the intended `gNBs` block, falling back to defaults or a partially initialized RRC context.
- Parsed config highlights:
  - CU: `Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"]`, but `gNBs.gNB_name=""`; PLMN configured as MCC=1/MNC=1, IDs present. F1 CU IP 127.0.0.5; NGU 192.168.8.43.
  - DU: coherent servingCellConfigCommon (n78/SCS 30k/106 PRBs), F1 to 127.0.0.5; rfsim server configured (will start after F1 Setup).
  - UE: rfsim client tries 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly.
- Initial mismatch: CU log shows blank CU name, then multiple PLMN mismatch messages and F1 Setup failure, consistent with CU not attaching the intended PLMN due to failing to bind the active gNB by name.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU prints `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and `F1AP: gNB_CU_name[0]` with an empty value.
- NG/GTPU threads start; F1AP listener created on 127.0.0.5.
- Critical anomalies:
  - `[NR_RRC] PLMNs received from CUUP (mcc:1, mnc:1) did not match with PLMNs in RRC (mcc:0, mnc:0)` → CU RRC has PLMN 0/0 (default) instead of 1/1.
  - Later upon F1 Setup Request from DU, CU reports `PLMN mismatch: CU 000.0, DU 00101`, then SCTP shutdown and F1 endpoint removal.
- Interpretation: Because `gNB_name` is empty while `Active_gNBs` expects `gNB-Eurecom-CU`, CU fails to map the active gNB to the configured `plmn_list`. RRC ends up with default PLMN 0/0, causing PLMN mismatches both on E1 (CUUP) and F1 (DU) procedures and leading to setup failure and disconnect.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU PHY/MAC init is nominal; frequencies and TDD pattern match config; no PHY asserts.
- DU notes: `[MAC] the CU reported F1AP Setup Failure, is there a configuration mismatch?` → confirms the failure originates on the CU side due to configuration inconsistency.
- With F1 Setup failing, DU will not activate radio nor start rfsim server.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY coherent with DU cell and repeatedly attempts TCP to 127.0.0.1:4043, all refused (errno 111).
- Since DU never starts the rfsim server (blocked by F1 Setup failure), UE cannot connect; these are secondary symptoms.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence correlation:
  - CU fails to bind active gNB due to `gNBs.gNB_name` being empty while `Active_gNBs` expects `gNB-Eurecom-CU` → RRC PLMN remains 0/0.
  - E1AP and F1AP procedures detect PLMN mismatch (CU 000.0 vs DU 00101) → CU triggers setup failure and closes SCTP.
  - DU cannot complete F1 Setup → radio/rfsim not started → UE connection refused.
- Root cause: empty `gNBs.gNB_name` breaks the CU’s selection of the intended `gNBs` entry, leading to default RRC PLMN and inter-component PLMN mismatch during setup.
- Context: In OAI, `Active_gNBs` must match an existing `gNBs.gNB_name`. If not, the CU may instantiate with default identifiers/PLMN, causing setup failures with DU and CU-UP.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Primary fix: set `gNBs.gNB_name` to the exact string referenced in `Active_gNBs` and ensure PLMN consistency.
- After fix, expected recovery: CU RRC loads PLMN 1/1 → E1AP and F1AP succeed → DU activates radio and starts rfsim on 4043 → UE can connect and proceed with RACH/RRC.
- Verification steps:
  - CU: logs show non-empty `gNB_CU_name[0] gNB-Eurecom-CU`; no PLMN mismatch; F1 Setup Complete.
  - DU: no F1AP Setup Failure; radio activation lines; UE attaches over rfsim.
  - UE: successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043; SSB detection; RACH; RRC connection.
- Corrected configuration snippet (focused on the issue):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-CU"],
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0xe00",
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",  
        "plmn_list": { "mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2, "snssaiList": { "sst": 1 } }
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {},
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
}
```

- Hardening:
  - Validate that `Active_gNBs[i]` matches a `gNBs.gNB_name` at startup; fail fast with a clear error if not.
  - Ensure PLMN settings are consistent across CU, DU, and UE; consider a single source of truth for PLMN values in your config generator.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; we infer the binding failure from empty CU name and PLMN mismatch lines. If issues persist after fixing `gNB_name`, also verify `plmn_list` values and that only one active gNB is selected.
