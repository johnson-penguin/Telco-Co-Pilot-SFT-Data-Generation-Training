## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The scenario is an OAI 5G NR Standalone setup using `--rfsim` (RF simulator) with CU/DU split over F1 and a single UE process. Expected bring-up flow:
  - DU and CU start → F1 SCTP association → F1 Setup → DU activates radio (starts rfsim server on 4043) → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB detection/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: **log_config.global_log_level=None**. In OAI configs, log levels are strings like "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal". The token `None` is invalid and, if unquoted or unexpected, can trigger libconfig syntax errors and abort initialization.
- Network config summary (key points):
  - `cu_conf.gNBs`: F1-C CU at `127.0.0.5`, remote DU `127.0.0.3`, NGU/S1U ports `2152`, AMF at `192.168.70.132`; `NETWORK_INTERFACES` for NG set to `192.168.8.43` (non-blocking for rfsim-only flows but notable).
  - `cu_conf.log_config`: has per-layer levels all set to `"info"`; the problematic `global_log_level` is not shown here but is stated as misconfigured in the error case file.
  - `du_conf`: RFSIM server mode (`serveraddr":"server"`, port `4043`), TDD config, PRACH index `98`, SSB `641280` (3619.2 MHz), F1 DU at `127.0.0.3` towards CU `127.0.0.5`.
  - `ue_conf`: SIM credentials only; UE will act as RFSIM client to `127.0.0.1:4043` by default.
- Initial mismatch vs logs/misconfigured_param:
  - CU logs show a libconfig syntax error and configuration module failing to load, consistent with an invalid token/value (e.g., `global_log_level=None`).
  - DU logs show repeated F1 SCTP connection refused to CU; UE logs show repeated connection refused to the rfsim server. Both are downstream effects of the CU not coming up (prevents F1 setup → DU radio not activated → rfsim server not listening).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Key lines:
  - `[LIBCONFIG] ... line 82: syntax error`
  - `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`
  - `config_get, section log_config skipped, config module not properly initialized`
  - `init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed`
  - `Getting configuration failed`
  - `function config_libconfig_init returned -1`
- Interpretation:
  - The CU fails during early configuration parsing. A syntax error typically arises from an invalid token (e.g., `None` unquoted) or an unsupported value for an enumerated string. Even if quoted as "None", validation may later fail, but here we explicitly see a parser syntax error, pointing to malformed syntax.
  - Because the CU process aborts pre-F1, it never opens the F1 SCTP server endpoint at `127.0.0.5:501` (as per config), so any DU attempts to connect will be refused.
- Cross-ref to `network_config.cu_conf`:
  - The provided JSON shows sane per-module log levels, but the misconfigured param refers to the actual error-case config file used on the command line. Therefore, the root issue is specific to that file (`cu_case_88.conf`) where `log_config.global_log_level=None` appears (likely unquoted or invalid), causing parse failure at/near line 82.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- Initialization proceeds: L1/MAC set up, TDD configured, frequencies match Band n78 at 3619.2 MHz, F1AP module starts, and DU tries to connect to CU:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by retries.
- Notably: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` indicates DU will not start the radio chain nor the rfsim server until F1 is established.
- No PRACH/MAC/PHY errors are present; the DU is healthy but blocked by missing CU.
- Cross-ref to gNB addressing/ports: DU is correctly trying CU `127.0.0.5` per config; failures are consistent with CU not listening due to aborted init.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY, then attempts to connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly:
  - `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)` in a loop.
- This is expected if the DU has not activated radio (and thus has not started the rfsim server listener). Since F1 isn't up, DU is waiting; hence UE cannot connect.
- Frequencies and numerology match DU’s: 3619.2 MHz, mu=1, N_RB=106—so RF parameters are aligned; the blocker is purely the unavailable rfsim server.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU crashes during config parsing → F1 server never starts at CU → DU’s F1 SCTP connections to `127.0.0.5` are refused → DU waits and does not activate radio → rfsim server on 4043 not started → UE’s TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 fails (errno 111) continuously.
- Misconfigured parameter-guided diagnosis:
  - `log_config.global_log_level=None` is invalid for OAI’s libconfig-based parser. If unquoted, `None` is an unknown bare token → syntax error. If quoted as "None", it’s an unsupported value; some builds validate and abort, but here the explicit `syntax error` points to the former.
  - The CU log explicitly shows a libconfig syntax error at the config file used by `-O .../cu_case_88.conf`, matching the misconfigured parameter and explaining the cascade of downstream failures.
- No PRACH or SIB issues are implicated in this case; the system never reaches RF activation.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Immediate fix (CU config):
  - Use a valid string value for `log_config.global_log_level`, e.g., `"info"` (or remove the field if not supported in your current CU schema). Ensure all log levels are quoted strings.
  - Validate the entire `log_config` section to avoid stray tokens or missing commas.
- After fixing CU, expected sequence: CU starts → DU F1 connects and completes setup → DU activates radio and starts rfsim server on 4043 → UE connects successfully and proceeds to SSB/PRACH → RRC attach.
- Suggested validation steps:
  - Run CU with `--check` (if available) or a config linter script to pre-validate.
  - Start CU first; confirm it listens on F1-C and reaches steady state.
  - Start DU; verify F1 Setup success and that DU logs "activating radio" and rfsim listener bind on 4043.
  - Start UE; confirm TCP connect succeeds and SSB detection begins.

        "IQfile": "/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Optional hardening:
  - Keep `Asn1_verbosity` at `none` or `annoying` per need, but avoid invalid tokens.
  - Ensure CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` matches a reachable local IP if NGAP is required; for rfsim-only bring-up, this mismatch is typically non-blocking but can be cleaned up.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are partial and without timestamps; exact ordering between CU abort and DU retries is inferred but consistent.
- The `misconfigured_param` references a field not present in the summarized `cu_conf` JSON (likely because the JSON is a normalized extract while the real `cu_case_88.conf` contained `global_log_level=None`). Root cause relies on the explicit CU parser error coupled with the provided misconfiguration hint.
- No external spec lookups were necessary; this failure is at configuration parse-time, not at NR procedure level.


## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The scenario is OAI 5G NR Standalone with `--rfsim --sa`, CU/DU split over F1, and one UE. Expected flow: CU up → DU F1 connects and completes Setup → DU activates radio and rfsim server (4043) → UE connects to rfsim → SSB/PRACH → RRC attach/PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter: **log_config.hw_log_level=None**. OAI expects string log levels ("trace","debug","info","warn","error","fatal"). The bare token `None` is invalid for libconfig and can cause a parser syntax error that aborts initialization.
- Network config key points:
  - `cu_conf.gNBs`: CU at `127.0.0.5` with F1 towards DU `127.0.0.3`; NGU `2152`; AMF `192.168.70.132`; NG interface IPs `192.168.8.43` (not critical for rfsim bring-up).
  - `cu_conf.log_config` in the JSON shows valid strings; the error case file on disk (`cu_case_89.conf`) likely contains `hw_log_level=None` (unquoted), causing the syntax error.
  - `du_conf`: rfsim server mode (`serveraddr":"server"`, `serverport`: 4043), TDD config, PRACH index `98`, SSB `641280` (3619.2 MHz), F1 DU at `127.0.0.3` targeting CU `127.0.0.5`.
  - `ue_conf`: SIM credentials only; UE attempts client connection to `127.0.0.1:4043` by default.
- Initial mismatch vs logs/misconfigured_param:
  - CU logs show libconfig syntax error at line 83 and module not loaded → consistent with invalid token `None`.
  - DU logs: repeated F1 SCTP connect refused to CU.
  - UE logs: repeated TCP connect refused to rfsim server. Downstream effects of CU failing early.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Key lines:
  - `[LIBCONFIG] ... line 83: syntax error`
  - `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`
  - `config_get, section log_config skipped, config module not properly initialized`
  - `init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed`
  - `function config_libconfig_init returned -1`
- Interpretation:
  - The parser hit an invalid token/value, aborting before any F1/NGAP setup. Unquoted `None` in `log_config.hw_log_level` matches this signature.
  - CU therefore never binds/listens for F1, leaving DU’s SCTP connects refused.
- Cross-ref with `network_config.cu_conf`:
  - The JSON representation is valid; the actual `cu_case_89.conf` passed with `-O` is the one containing the malformed value.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC, configures TDD and carriers, starts F1AP client: 
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with retries.
- `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` indicates DU will not start radio nor rfsim server until F1 Setup completes.
- No PHY/MAC error (e.g., PRACH) appears; DU is healthy and blocked by absent CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE brings up PHY and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` → `errno(111)` connection refused in a loop.
- This is expected because DU hasn’t activated radio or started the rfsim server (blocked on F1). RF numerology and frequency match DU; connectivity is the blocker.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Correlated sequence: CU config parse fails (syntax error at line 83 due to `hw_log_level=None`) → CU never starts F1 → DU’s SCTP attempts to `127.0.0.5` are refused → DU doesn’t activate radio → rfsim server not listening → UE TCP connects to 4043 fail.
- The misconfigured parameter directly explains the CU abort; all other symptoms cascade from this early failure. No PRACH/SIB/ASN issues are involved because the system never reaches those stages.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix CU config:
  - Set `log_config.hw_log_level` to a valid quoted string (e.g., `"info"`). If the current schema doesn’t accept `hw_log_level` at CU, remove that key entirely from CU’s `log_config`.
  - Ensure every log level value is quoted; avoid bare tokens.
- Bring-up validation after fix:
  - Start CU → verify no parser errors and that F1 server side is up/steady.
  - Start DU → verify F1 association success and the log line indicating radio activation; confirm rfsim listener binds to 4043.
  - Start UE → confirm TCP connect succeeds and SSB detection begins.
- Corrected snippets (embedded JSON within `network_config`), with comments on changes:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        "global_log_level": "info",
        "hw_log_level": "info",  // fixed: replace invalid None with a valid string or remove if unsupported
        "phy_log_level": "info",
        "mac_log_level": "info",
        "rlc_log_level": "info",
        "pdcp_log_level": "info",
        "rrc_log_level": "info",
        "ngap_log_level": "info",
        "f1ap_log_level": "info"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server",
        "serverport": 4043,
        "options": [],
        "modelname": "AWGN",
        "IQfile": "/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Optional hygiene:
  - If NGAP is exercised, ensure CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` is a valid local IP. For rfsim-only loops, this mismatch is typically harmless.
  - Keep `Asn1_verbosity` values valid.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs lack timestamps; ordering is inferred but consistent with a CU parse failure first.
- The summarized JSON is clean; the actual on-disk `cu_case_89.conf` contains the malformed `hw_log_level=None`. Root cause ties the explicit parser error to the misconfigured parameter.
- No external spec lookup required; this is a configuration parse-time failure rather than a 38.211/38.331 procedure issue.
