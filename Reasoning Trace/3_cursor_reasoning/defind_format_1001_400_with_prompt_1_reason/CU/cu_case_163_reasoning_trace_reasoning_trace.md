## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The deployment is OAI 5G NR SA using rfsimulator. Evidence:
- CU/DU logs show SA mode and typical OAI thread/task bring-up.
- UE logs show repeated attempts to connect to an RF simulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043.
- DU shows `rfsimulator` configured and is “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio,” which typically delays starting the RF simulator server.

Expected flow:
1) CU initializes, connects to AMF via NGAP; 2) CU starts F1-C server; 3) DU connects F1-C to CU and completes F1 Setup; 4) DU activates radio and rfsim server; 5) UE connects to rfsim server; 6) SIB/PRACH/RACH; 7) RRC attach; 8) PDU session.

Guiding misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.tr_s_preference=invalid_enum_value` (CU). This is the southbound transport preference at the CU for the CU/DU split interface. In an OAI CU/DU deployment, it must be a valid enum that leads the CU to create the F1-C server (for split F1). An invalid value prevents proper split selection and F1 task initialization, so the DU’s F1 connection gets refused and radio activation is blocked. Consequently the UE cannot connect to rfsim (connection refused).

Network config highlights and early mismatches:
- cu_conf.gNBs:
  - `tr_s_preference: "invalid_enum_value"` (explicitly misconfigured)
  - `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF: 192.168.8.43` (matches CU log parsing)
  - F1 side addressing: `local_s_address: 127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address: 127.0.0.3`
- du_conf:
  - MACRLCs: `tr_s_preference: "local_L1"`, `tr_n_preference: "f1"`, `local_n_address: 127.0.0.3`, `remote_n_address: 127.0.0.5`
  - Serving cell config consistent with 3.6192 GHz, µ=1, N_RB=106; DU logs confirm the same.
  - rfsimulator server configured (`serverport: 4043`).
- ue_conf: IMSI and keys present; RF side relies on rfsim connectivity which is failing.

The misconfiguration at CU explains the DU’s repeated F1 SCTP connection refusals and the UE’s repeated rfsim connection refusals.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key observations:
- SA mode; CU initializes NGAP and sends NGSetupRequest, receiving NGSetupResponse:
  - "Send NGSetupRequest to AMF" → "Received NGSetupResponse" (NGAP OK)
- CU creates GTP-U and RRC tasks; no F1-C server bring-up messages are seen.
- Early RAN context shows no MAC/RLC/L1/RU at CU side (`RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0, RC.nb_RU = 0`), consistent with CU-only split but also consistent with a southbound transport not being properly configured.
- No explicit error is printed about `tr_s_preference` in this excerpt, but absence of F1AP server init is the key anomaly.

Cross-reference with `cu_conf.gNBs.tr_s_preference`: set to invalid enum. In OAI, invalid split/transport selection typically prevents starting the southbound stack (F1 tasks), which would cause the DU’s F1 SCTP to be refused at 127.0.0.5.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1; config shows µ=1, N_RB=106, band 78, SSB at 641280 → 3619200000 Hz; logs match.
- DU attempts F1 setup:
  - "F1AP: Starting F1AP at DU"
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5"
  - Repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and "[F1AP] retrying…"
- DU remains "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio"; therefore it never activates RU/rfsim server.
- No PHY/MAC crashes or PRACH assertions; the unit is simply stalled before radio activation due to F1 failure.

This is exactly what happens if the CU has not started an F1-C server because the southbound split transport selection failed (invalid `tr_s_preference`).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for µ=1, N_RB=106 at 3619200000 Hz (matching DU), then repeatedly:
  - "Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043" → "connect() … failed, errno(111)"
- This indicates the rfsim server is not listening. In OAI CU/DU+rfsim, the DU brings up the rfsim server only after F1 Setup completes and radio is activated. Because F1 fails, the rfsim server is never started, so the UE connection is refused.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU: NGAP with AMF is fine; missing F1 server bring-up is the anomaly.
- DU: F1 client connection to CU at 127.0.0.5: SCTP refused repeatedly; DU logs explicitly wait for F1 Setup before radio activation.
- UE: rfsim connection refused because DU didn’t start the server (blocked by missing F1 Setup).
- `misconfigured_param`: `gNBs.tr_s_preference=invalid_enum_value` in CU’s config. Valid values are implementation-defined enumerations used by OAI to select split transport (e.g., `"f1"` for CU/DU split on F1; other contexts have values like `"local_mac"`, `"nfapi"`, etc.). An invalid value prevents F1 tasks from starting on CU, causing DU SCTP refusal and UE rfsim refusal. The timelines match exactly.

Root cause: Invalid `tr_s_preference` on the CU prevents F1-C server initialization, blocking DU F1 setup and downstream radio activation and UE connectivity.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix: Set CU `gNBs.tr_s_preference` to a valid value consistent with CU/DU split. Given DU `tr_n_preference: "f1"` and addressing `127.0.0.5/127.0.0.3`, the CU should use `"f1"` southbound.
- After change, restart CU first (so it starts F1-C server), then DU (so it connects), then UE (so it can connect to rfsim).
- Validate in logs:
  - CU should log F1AP server/thread creation and receive F1SetupRequest.
  - DU should log F1 SCTP association established, F1SetupResponse received, then "activating radio" and rfsim server listening on 127.0.0.1:4043.
  - UE should connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceed to SSB detection, PRACH, RRC, etc.
- Optional checks:
  - Ensure CU/DU F1 IPs/ports match: CU `local_s_address: 127.0.0.5`, DU `remote_n_address: 127.0.0.5`, DU `local_n_address: 127.0.0.3`, CU `remote_s_address: 127.0.0.3`.
  - Confirm firewall rules allow SCTP on the loopback if applicable.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; we infer ordering from typical OAI bring-up and explicit messages.
- Exact enum set for `tr_s_preference` is implementation-defined in OAI; here we use operational knowledge that CU/DU split requires `"f1"` on CU southbound. If a different split is intended, choose the corresponding valid enum.
- If problems persist after the fix, inspect CU logs for F1 task/server bring-up and verify loopback SCTP connectivity and that DU is not pinned to a different IP/port.
