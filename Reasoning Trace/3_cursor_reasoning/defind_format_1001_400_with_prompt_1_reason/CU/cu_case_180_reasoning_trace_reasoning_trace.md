## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The scenario is OAI NR SA using RF Simulator: CU/DU run in SA mode; DU would host rfsimulator on port 4043; UE attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU initializes, brings up NGAP (to AMF) and F1-C listener → DU connects via F1-C and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio and starts rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim → SSB sync → PRACH → RRC/NAS.
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=999.999.999.999` (invalid IPv4). The CU log also shows it “Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 999.999.999.999”, then fails in SCTP association with `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999)`.
- Parsed config highlights:
  - CU addresses: F1-C at `127.0.0.5` (toward DU `127.0.0.3`). NG user-plane NGU `192.168.8.43:2152`. AMF peer configured as `amf_ip_address.ipv4=192.168.70.132` (valid). However, `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` is set to the invalid `999.999.999.999`.
  - DU: F1 client to CU `127.0.0.5`, serving cell n78/SCS 30 kHz/106 PRBs coherent; rfsimulator server configured on 4043.
  - UE: rfsim client tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly and fails.
- Initial mismatch: invalid NG-AMF address string leads to name resolution failure and assertion in CU’s SCTP handling; CU exits before F1-C is usable.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Normal CU start messages (SA mode, build info, identifiers).
- `[GNB_APP] Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 999.999.999.999` → CU accepts the invalid string.
- Threads for NGAP/RRC/GTPU/F1 are created; then:
  - `Assertion (status == 0) failed!` in `sctp_handle_new_association_req()` and `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999) failed: Name or service not known` → the NGAP peer address resolution fails, causing an assert and immediate process exit.
- Therefore, the CU terminates and never becomes available for DU F1-C connections.
- Cross-reference with config: the invalid address is from `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF`. In OAI, this field should be the CU’s local bind IP for NGAP (local NG interface), while the AMF peer is taken from `amf_ip_address.ipv4`. Using an invalid value here (or misusing as peer) triggers the observed failure.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU PHY/MAC initialization is normal (antenna, TDD pattern, 3.6192 GHz, N_RB 106). No PHY errors.
- F1AP: DU repeatedly attempts SCTP to CU `127.0.0.5` and gets `Connection refused`, with retries.
- DU remains in `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → thus DU never starts RF simulator server.
- This is a secondary effect: CU process crashed due to NG address error, so F1-C on CU is not listening.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE PHY init matches DU cell parameters.
- UE repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` connection refused.
- As DU never activated radio/started rfsim server (blocked by missing F1 with CU), UE connection attempts fail; these are downstream symptoms.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence correlation:
  - CU parses invalid NG AMF address `999.999.999.999` → NGAP SCTP association setup calls `getaddrinfo` on this string → resolution fails → assertion in SCTP task → CU exits.
  - With CU down, DU’s F1-C connection attempts are refused → DU stays pre-activation → rfsim server not started → UE’s TCP connects fail.
- Root cause: invalid `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` in CU configuration. This field must be a valid local IPv4 for the CU NG interface (e.g., `192.168.8.43`), not an invalid IP. The AMF remote peer should be configured via `amf_ip_address.ipv4`.
- Standards/implementation context:
  - NGAP runs over SCTP; proper local bind and peer resolution are required. Invalid addresses cause `getaddrinfo` failures and OAI assertions during association setup.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix the CU NG interface address to a valid local IPv4 and ensure the AMF peer remains the real AMF IP.
- Suggested corrections:
  - Set `NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` to the CU’s local NG interface IP (e.g., `192.168.8.43`, consistent with NGU).
  - Keep `amf_ip_address.ipv4` as the AMF peer (`192.168.70.132`).
- After fix, expected recovery: CU no longer asserts; NGAP attempts proceed; F1-C listener remains active; DU completes F1 Setup and activates radio; rfsim server starts; UE connects and proceeds with RACH/RRC.
- Verification checklist:
  - CU: no `getaddrinfo`/assert errors; NGAP state transitions visible; F1AP listener up.
  - DU: successful SCTP association to CU, F1 Setup completes, radio activation lines, rfsim listening on 4043.
  - UE: successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, SSB detection, RACH and RRC messages.
- Corrected configuration snippets (focused on the issue):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "amf_ip_address": {
          "ipv4": "192.168.70.132"
        },
        "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",  
          "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
          "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
        }
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {},
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
}
```

- Hardening:
  - Validate all IPs for syntactic correctness and local interface existence before starting CU.
  - Ensure routing between CU NG interface and AMF IP is correct; check firewalls for SCTP (NGAP) and UDP 2152 (GTP-U).

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; timing is inferred. The CU crash conclusively follows from the assertion and `getaddrinfo` failure on the invalid IP string.
- If issues persist post-fix, verify that `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` is indeed a local IP and that `amf_ip_address.ipv4` resolves/reaches the AMF; also confirm SCTP is permitted end-to-end.
