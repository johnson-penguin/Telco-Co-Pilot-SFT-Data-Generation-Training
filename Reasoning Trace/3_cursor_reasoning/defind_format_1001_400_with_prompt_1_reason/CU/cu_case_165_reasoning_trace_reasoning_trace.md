## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs show OAI NR SA with `--rfsim --sa`. Expected call flow: CU boots (NGAP ready) → DU boots and establishes F1-C to CU → DU activates radio (rfsim server listening) → UE connects to rfsim server → cell search/SSB → RACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- The provided misconfigured parameter is: **security.drb_integrity=invalid_enum_value**. CU logs explicitly flag: "bad drb_integrity value 'invalid_enum_value', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed". This indicates schema validation failure at CU RRC security config parsing.
- Network config parsing (key items):
  - CU `security`:
    - `ciphering_algorithms`: [nea3, nea2, nea1, nea0]
    - `integrity_algorithms`: [nia2, nia0]
    - `drb_ciphering`: yes
    - `drb_integrity`: invalid_enum_value  ← invalid (must be "yes"|"no")
  - CU F1 addresses: CU `local_s_address` 127.0.0.5, DU remote points to that. AMF IP 192.168.70.132; NGU/S1U 192.168.8.43.
  - DU F1 addresses: DU `local_n_address` 127.0.0.3, remote CU 127.0.0.5. rfsim serverport 4043.
  - DU PRACH and TDD parameters are otherwise consistent (band n78, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs, SSB 641280 → 3619.2 MHz). UE PHY shows same DL/UL freq and numerology.

Initial hypothesis guided by the misconfiguration: CU fails early on RRC/security configuration due to invalid `drb_integrity` value. As a consequence, CU never brings up F1-C. DU then repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (connection refused). UE cannot connect to rfsim server because DU defers radio activation until F1 setup completes (no server listening at 127.0.0.1:4043), leading to repeated `errno(111)`.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU starts in SA mode and reads config, then prints:
  - "Data Radio Bearer count 1" → a DRB is configured.
  - Critical error: "[RRC] in configuration file, bad drb_integrity value 'invalid_enum_value', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed".
- There is no evidence of NGAP connection establishment, nor F1-C listener, after this error. The CU likely aborts initialization of the RRC/security stack or continues in a degraded state that prevents F1 from coming up.
- Cross-reference with CU network config shows the invalid enum exactly in `security.drb_integrity`. This directly explains CU refusing/never accepting F1 associations.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU boots fully through PHY/MAC init, configures TDD and PRACH, and starts F1AP:
  - F1-C DU IP 127.0.0.3, connecting to CU 127.0.0.5.
  - Immediately: repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by F1AP retry messages.
  - DU prints: "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" — standard OAI behavior; RU/radio activation is gated on successful F1 Setup.
- No PHY crash or PRACH assertion is observed. The blocker is strictly F1-C connection refusal from CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY with matching carrier and numerology (3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, SCS 30 kHz).
- UE acts as rfsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, failing with `errno(111)`.
- This indicates no rfsim server is listening. In OAI rfsim setups, the DU hosts the rfsim server and only starts it after F1 Setup with CU. Since DU is stuck waiting for CU, the server never starts, so UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU encounters a config validation error at RRC security (`drb_integrity`).
  - Because CU isn't fully initialized, F1-C endpoint is not accepting connections → DU’s SCTP attempts are refused.
  - DU, lacking F1 Setup Response, defers radio activation and rfsim server startup.
  - UE repeatedly fails TCP connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Root cause: **Invalid CU parameter `security.drb_integrity=invalid_enum_value`**. OAI expects a boolean-like enum with accepted values "yes" or "no". The DU/UE configurations themselves are consistent; the cascading failures arise from CU failing to initialize due to this misconfiguration.
- Standards/context: In NR, integrity protection on DRBs is optional and typically disabled for user-plane DRBs (PDCP). OAI’s config uses `drb_integrity` to gate enabling integrity for DRBs; invalid values cause an immediate configuration error.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Set `security.drb_integrity` to a valid value. Given common practice and OAI defaults, prefer `"no"` unless you explicitly test DRB integrity.
- After correction, verify the following sequence:
  1) CU boots without the RRC error and starts F1-C listener.
  2) DU connects over SCTP, completes F1 Setup; DU logs proceed past "waiting for F1 Setup Response" and activate radio.
  3) DU starts rfsim server; UE connects successfully, proceeds to RACH and RRC attach.
- Optional diagnostics if issues persist:
  - Increase CU `rrc_log_level` to `debug` for security config traces.
  - Confirm DU `remote_n_address` and CU `local_s_address` match (127.0.0.5) and ports (500/501) are consistent.
  - Ensure UE points to the correct rfsim IP/port if running components across hosts/containers.

Corrected config snippets (JSON):

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "security": {
      "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
      "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],
      "drb_ciphering": "yes",
      "drb_integrity": "no"  
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Set to "no" to reflect typical DRB integrity usage in OAI and avoid performance impact. If you require integrity on DRBs, set to "yes" (also valid).

No changes are required to `du_conf` or `ue_conf` based on the presented logs. For completeness, ensure DU rfsim serverport remains aligned with UE (4043) and local loopback is intended.

```json
{
  "du_conf": {
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "server",
      "serverport": 4043
    }
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
      "serverport": 4043
    }
  }
}
```

If UE does not already have `rfsimulator` fields, add them as shown to make the target explicit when all components run on the same host. If components are split, adjust IPs accordingly.

## 7. Limitations

- CU logs are truncated after the configuration error; we infer CU does not bring up F1-C based on DU’s repeated SCTP connection refusals.
- UE logs only show client-side connection attempts, not cell search/RACH, consistent with an absent rfsim server.
- This analysis relies on OAI’s documented behavior and the explicit CU error message; no external specification lookup is required for parameter validity in this case.
