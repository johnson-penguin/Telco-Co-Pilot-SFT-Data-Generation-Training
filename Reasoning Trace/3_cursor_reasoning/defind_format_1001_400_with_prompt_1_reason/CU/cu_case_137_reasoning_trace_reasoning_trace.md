\n## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
This case is OAI 5G NR Standalone over rfsimulator. Normal flow: CU starts, validates config, launches F1-C server and NGAP toward AMF → DU starts, connects via F1-C to CU → after F1 Setup, DU activates radio and starts the rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server, performs PRACH and RRC attach → PDU session.

Misconfigured parameter: security.ciphering_algorithms[0]= (empty). Per 3GPP TS 33.501, NR ciphering algorithms are NEA0/1/2; OAI expects strings like "nea2", "nea1", "nea0". An empty string is invalid and triggers a CU startup error in the security/RRC stack.

Network config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs: CU listens F1-C at 127.0.0.5 (server) with DU peer 127.0.0.3; NGAP/GTU on 192.168.8.43; tr_s_preference "f1" (CU-CP only role consistent with logs).
- cu_conf.security.ciphering_algorithms: ["", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"] → first item invalid; integrity list is ["nia2", "nia0"], which is valid.
- du_conf: n78, µ=1, N_RB=106, PRACH index 98; MACRLC tr_s_preference "local_L1"; rfsimulator server port 4043.
- ue_conf: standard test IMSI/K/OPC; UE config consistent with DU numerology/frequency.

Initial mismatch: CU logs explicitly report unknown ciphering algorithm "" at startup, matching the misconfiguration. DU logs show repeated F1 SCTP connection refusals; UE logs show repeated TCP connection refusals to rfsim server—both downstream consequences when CU fails to complete initialization and F1 server is not up, causing DU to withhold radio activation and rfsim server startup.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU enters SA mode, then immediately logs: unknown ciphering algorithm "" in section "security". After that, only config section reads are shown; there are no NGAP success logs nor F1 server readiness logs. This indicates CU security/RRC initialization aborted due to invalid ciphering algorithm selection.

Cross-reference with cu_conf:
- security.ciphering_algorithms[0] is an empty string. Valid entries are "nea2", "nea1", and "nea0". OAI usually prioritizes the first listed algorithm; an invalid first entry is treated as a fatal config error.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC, reads ServingCellConfigCommon, configures TDD, and starts F1AP as a client to CU 127.0.0.5.
- Repeated SCTP connect failures (Connection refused) indicate CU’s F1-C server is not listening—consistent with CU aborting earlier.
- DU remains in "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio", so radio and rfsim server are not started.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for µ=1 at 3619.2 MHz and runs as rfsimulator client to 127.0.0.1:4043. All attempts fail with errno(111) (connection refused), because the DU never started the rfsim server (blocked by missing F1 Setup completion).

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Root cause: CU misconfiguration with an empty ciphering algorithm entry (security.ciphering_algorithms[0]=""). CU rejects the configuration, preventing F1 server startup.
- Consequences: DU’s SCTP to F1-C is refused → F1 Setup never completes → DU radio stays inactive and rfsim server is not started → UE’s TCP connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 is refused repeatedly.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Required configuration fix (CU):
- Replace the empty string with a valid ciphering algorithm and order by preference. Typical robust set: ["nea2", "nea1", "nea0"]. Keep integrity list to ["nia2", "nia0"] (or ["nia2", "nia1", "nia0"]).

Corrected snippet (only changed fields shown):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea2", "nea1", "nea0"], // corrected: removed empty first entry
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Validation steps after fix:
- Start CU and ensure no "unknown ciphering algorithm" error; verify F1AP server binds on 127.0.0.5 (logs should show F1 ready) and NGSetup with AMF proceeds.
- Start DU; confirm SCTP association and F1 Setup complete; DU activates radio and starts rfsim server.
- Start UE; confirm TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds and that PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session follow.

If further issues persist:
- Increase CU/DU log levels for RRC, F1AP, and security. Confirm no other invalid entries in `security`.
- Ensure algorithm overlap with the UE stack (NEA2/NIA2 are commonly supported).
- Confirm loopback addresses and ports are unused by other processes; check local firewall does not block SCTP on loopback.

## 7. Limitations
- CU logs are truncated; inference about F1 server absence is based on DU’s SCTP refusals and the early security error.
- UE logs are limited to rfsim TCP connection attempts; RRC/PDU session phases are not reached due to upstream failure.
- Assumes standard OAI behavior consistent with TS 33.501 (NEA0/1/2, NIA0/1/2) and OAI’s strict startup validation of the first-listed security algorithms.
