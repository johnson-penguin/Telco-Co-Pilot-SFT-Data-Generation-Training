## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs indicate OAI NR SA with RF simulator: CU/DU started with `--rfsim --sa`. Expected attach flow: CU init → DU init → F1-C association → CU connects to AMF (NGAP) → DU activates radio → UE connects to rfsim server → PRACH → RRC connection → Registration/PDU session.
- The provided misconfiguration is **gNBs.tracking_area_code = -1**. CU log explicitly rejects this: `config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: -1 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533`, then exits.
- Parsed network_config:
  - cu_conf.gNBs: `gNB_ID 0xe00`, `local_s_address 127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address 127.0.0.3`, AMF IPv4 `192.168.70.132`, NGU/S1U IP `192.168.8.43`. No TAC field shown in `cu_conf` JSON, but the runtime CU `.conf` (from CMDLINE) contained `tracking_area_code=-1` and caused exit.
  - du_conf.gNBs[0]: `tracking_area_code 1`, PLMN MCC/MNC 1/1 len2, band n78, 106 PRBs, TDD config present, PRACH index 98, SSB at 641280 (3.6192 GHz). rfsimulator: `serveraddr: "server"`, `serverport: 4043` (DU acts as server).
  - ue_conf: IMSI `001010000000001`, dnn `oai`, typical test UE. UE tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` per logs.
- Initial mismatch summary: CU rejects config at startup due to invalid TAC; DU waits for F1 and does not activate radio; UE cannot connect to rfsim server as no DU server is listening.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode/version/init: SA mode confirmed; build hash `b2c9a1d2b5`.
- Immediately after reading config, CU reports: `tracking_area_code: -1 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533` and `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`, then `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- No NGAP/AMF or F1AP startup progresses beyond config parsing; therefore CU never opens F1-C on `127.0.0.5:500` nor NGAP towards AMF.
- Cross-check with config: CU `local_s_address 127.0.0.5`, DU expects CU at `127.0.0.5`. But CU is not running due to TAC error, explaining DU SCTP connection refusals.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU and parses ServingCellConfigCommon correctly (n78, SSB 641280, 106 PRBs, TDD pattern). It starts F1AP client side and repeatedly attempts SCTP connect to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` ⇒ `Connect failed: Connection refused` with retries.
- DU states: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`. In OAI, rfsimulator server typically starts with RU bring-up; however, full radio activation (and stable rfsim service) is deferred until F1 Setup succeeds. Because CU is down, DU cannot complete F1 setup.
- No PRACH/PHY runtime activity with UEs occurs since F1 isn’t up; DU is effectively idle and its rfsim server socket is not accepting connections (explains UE connection refused).
- PRACH config is valid: `prach_ConfigurationIndex 98`, ZCZC 13, target power -96. No PHY asserts visible.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes for n78, 106 PRBs, SR 61.44 Msps. It runs as rfsim client: `Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side`.
- It repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` Connection refused.
- Given DU `rfsimulator.serveraddr: "server"` and port 4043, the DU is supposed to host the server locally. Connection refused indicates the DU server is not listening—consistent with DU waiting for F1 Setup Response and CU being down.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU aborts at config check due to invalid TAC (-1). No F1-C endpoint is created.
  - DU attempts F1-C towards CU at 127.0.0.5, gets SCTP refused repeatedly. It remains in `waiting for F1 Setup Response` and does not fully activate RU/rfsim server.
  - UE, acting as rfsim client, cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, because DU’s rfsim server is not active.
- Root cause: Misconfigured CU `tracking_area_code=-1`. OAI’s config checker enforces TAC range [1..65533] (the CU log prints this). With CU down, the entire chain is blocked (DU cannot establish F1; UE cannot connect to RFsim).
- Spec/context notes:
  - In 5GC, TAI contains TAC; OAI validates TAC range per internal constraints; values 1..65533 are accepted. A negative TAC is invalid by both common-sense integer domains and OAI checks.
  - This is not a PRACH/SIB issue; PHY configs look coherent across DU/UE (n78, 106 PRB, SCS µ=1, same center freq).

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Primary fix: Set CU `gNBs.tracking_area_code` to a valid value and align with DU (e.g., 1). Ensure CU starts cleanly before DU, then start UE.
- Validation steps:
  - After change, CU should proceed to NGAP setup attempts; DU should receive F1 Setup Response; DU should activate radio; UE should connect to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceed to detect SSB, PRACH, and RRC connection.
  - Monitor CU for `[NGAP]` logs and DU for `F1AP SETUP RESPONSE` and `Activating gNB`, and UE for `Decoded MIB/SIB` and `RRCConnectionRequest`.
- Optional hygiene:
  - Keep PLMN consistent (already 001/01). Keep `gNB_ID`/`nr_cellid` consistent (already aligned).
  - Confirm CU `NETWORK_INTERFACES` align with host routing to AMF (`192.168.70.132`).

        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-DU",
        "tracking_area_code": 1
        // Unchanged; already valid and aligned with CU
      }
    ],
    "rfsimulator": {
      "serveraddr": "server",
      "serverport": 4043
      // DU remains the rfsim server; once F1 is up, UE will connect successfully
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "ue_conf": {
    // No changes required here for TAC; UE uses PLMN 001/01 and connects to rfsim on 127.0.0.1:4043 by default
  }
}
```

Operational sequence after fix:
- Start CU (verify no config errors), then start DU (watch for F1 Setup Response), then start UE (watch for rfsim connect OK, MIB/SIB decode, PRACH).

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are partial (no timestamps), and `cu_conf` JSON excerpt did not include `tracking_area_code`, but the live CU `.conf` (visible in CMDLINE path) clearly contained the invalid value and triggered the fatal check.
- No need for spec/tool lookup: CU log explicitly states valid TAC range; correlations are unambiguous given connection refusals and rfsim behavior.
