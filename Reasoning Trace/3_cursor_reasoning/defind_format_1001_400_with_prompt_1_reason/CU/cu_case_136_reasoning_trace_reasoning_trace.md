\n## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
This scenario is OAI 5G NR Standalone using rfsimulator. Expected sequence: CU initializes and starts F1-C server and NGAP toward AMF → DU initializes PHY/MAC and connects via F1-C to CU → after F1 Setup, DU activates radio and starts rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server, performs PRACH, RRC attachment, and PDU session setup.

Misconfigured parameter provided: security.integrity_algorithms[0]=nia9. In 5G per 3GPP TS 33.501, supported integrity algorithms are NIA0, NIA1, NIA2. "nia9" is invalid. OAI typically validates the configured list at startup; an unknown integrity algorithm triggers an error and can prevent proper startup of CU’s RRC/security stack and F1 server.

Network config highlights:
- cu_conf.gNBs: CU binds F1-C on 127.0.0.5 (server) with DU peer 127.0.0.3; NGAP/GTU on 192.168.8.43; tr_s_preference "f1" (CU-CP only).
- cu_conf.security.integrity_algorithms: ["nia9", "nia0"] → first entry invalid.
- du_conf: n78, µ=1, N_RB=106, PRACH index 98; MACRLC tr_s_preference "local_L1"; rfsimulator server configured on port 4043.
- ue_conf: standard test IMSI/K/OPC; UE logs show µ=1 at 3619.2 MHz matching DU.

Initial mismatch against misconfigured_param: CU log reports unknown integrity algorithm "nia9" at startup, consistent with the provided misconfiguration. DU and UE subsequently exhibit symptoms (F1 SCTP refused; rfsim connect failures) that follow from CU failing to start or bind required services after the config error.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA mode and immediately logs: unknown integrity algorithm "nia9" in section "security". This occurs before other subsystems fully start. Afterward, only config file section reads are shown; there is no evidence of NGAP connection or F1 server binding in these logs.
- With an invalid integrity algorithm at the head of the list, OAI CU may abort initialization of the security/RRC layer, which can prevent F1AP task/server from starting.

Cross-reference with cu_conf:
- security.integrity_algorithms contains an invalid value first ("nia9"). Valid options are "nia2", "nia1", and "nia0"; OAI typically prioritizes the first algorithm offered, so placing an invalid one first is fatal.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly, reads ServingCellConfigCommon, sets TDD patterns, computes frequencies, and starts F1AP as client to CU at 127.0.0.5.
- Repeated SCTP connect failures: Connection refused, followed by retries. DU prints it is waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio. This shows CU is not listening on F1-C due to its earlier configuration error, so DU cannot proceed to radio activation.
- No PRACH or PHY assertion errors; the failure point is strictly at F1 establishment.

Link to network_config:
- DU endpoints and ports match CU configuration. Therefore, refusal is not an IP/port mismatch but a server-not-started condition on CU driven by the invalid security setting.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for µ=1, N_RB=106 at 3619.2 MHz, then runs as rfsimulator client attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043. All attempts fail with errno(111) (connection refused).
- In OAI rfsim, the DU starts the rfsim server only after F1 Setup completes and radio is activated. Since DU cannot complete F1 due to CU not listening, the DU never starts the rfsim server; hence the UE’s repeated TCP connection failures.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU fails early on security config: invalid integrity algorithm "nia9" → CU’s RRC/security/F1 initialization does not complete → F1-C server not bound on 127.0.0.5.
- DU attempts SCTP to CU repeatedly and is refused → DU never receives F1 Setup Response → DU does not activate radio or start rfsim server.
- UE attempts to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 and is refused → no PRACH/RRC possible.
- Thus, the single misconfigured CU parameter security.integrity_algorithms[0]=nia9 is the root cause cascading across components.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration fix on CU:
- Replace the invalid integrity algorithm with a valid one and order by preference. Typical and widely supported: ["nia2", "nia1", "nia0"]. Ensure ciphering list is valid as well (current list is fine).

Corrected snippets (only changed fields shown):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia1", "nia0"] // corrected: removed invalid "nia9"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational validation after fix:
- Start CU; confirm no "unknown integrity algorithm" error; verify F1AP server binds and logs F1 readiness.
- Start DU; observe successful SCTP association and F1 Setup; DU should then activate radio and start rfsim server.
- Start UE; confirm TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds, followed by PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session.

If issues persist:
- Increase CU/DU log levels for RRC, F1AP, and security. Confirm CU listens on 127.0.0.5 and the ports are free.
- Verify algorithm negotiation: some UEs/networks may only accept NIA2; ensure overlap with UE capabilities.
- Cross-check that no other invalid entries exist in the `security` section (typos, casing).

## 7. Limitations
- CU logs are truncated; absence of explicit F1 server start logs is inferred from DU’s connection refusals and the early security error.
- UE logs show only rfsim TCP failures; deeper RRC procedures are not reached due to upstream blocking.
- Analysis assumes standard OAI behavior per TS 33.501 (integrity algorithms limited to NIA0/1/2) and OAI’s startup validation rejecting unknown algorithms.
