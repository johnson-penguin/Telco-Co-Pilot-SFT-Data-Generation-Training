## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
Based on logs and config, this is an OAI NR SA rfsimulator setup: CU and DU split (F1), UE connects over `rfsimulator`. Expected flow: process configs → initialize CU and DU → F1-C association (DU→CU) → DU activates radio → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB detect/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session. The input highlights a targeted misconfiguration: **misconfigured_param = `security.drb_integrity=invalid_enum_value`** in `cu_conf`.

- Key network parameters parsed:
  - **CU (`cu_conf.gNBs`)**: `tr_s_preference: "f1"`, `local_s_address: 127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address: 127.0.0.3`. `amf_ip_address.ipv4: 192.168.70.132`. NG/NGU IFs on `192.168.8.43`. Security: `drb_ciphering: yes`, `drb_integrity: invalid_enum_value`.
  - **DU (`du_conf`)**: F1 towards CU `remote_n_address: 127.0.0.5`, local `127.0.0.3`. RF sim server: `serveraddr: "server"`, `serverport: 4043`. NR numerology μ=1, `N_RB=106`, band n78, TDD config with 8 DL / 3 UL per 10-slot period. PRACH: `prach_ConfigurationIndex: 98`, `zeroCorrelationZoneConfig: 13`, root seq PR=2, etc.
  - **UE (`ue_conf`)**: IMSI `001010000000001`, dnn `oai`.

Initial mismatch spotted immediately in CU logs: RRC prints an error for `drb_integrity` invalid value; only `yes` or `no` are allowed by OAI config schema for DRB integrity enablement at CU.

Implication: If CU fails to initialize RRC/security configuration due to invalid enum, CU may not start F1C SCTP server; DU F1 association will fail; UE will not find rfsim server (provided by DU radio activation), causing repeated connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts SA: "running in SA mode"; version stamp present.
- `GNB_APP` initializes context but notably shows `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0, RC.nb_RU = 0` which is consistent with CU-only role.
- F1AP CU identity/name set; SDAP disabled; DRB count 1.
- Critical error:
  - `[RRC] in configuration file, bad drb_integrity value 'invalid_enum_value', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed`.
- Command line confirms `--rfsim --sa` with a CU config file.
- After config parsing messages, there is no evidence of NGAP to AMF establishment or F1-C listener ready state; logs end after config reads. This suggests the CU halts or leaves F1C unbound due to config validation failure.
- Cross-reference with `cu_conf.security.drb_integrity = invalid_enum_value`: matches error exactly. In OAI, this parameter is a boolean-like enum ("yes"|"no") controlling whether PDCP integrity protection is enabled on DRBs. Invalid value triggers RRC config parse error and prevents moving forward to F1/NGAP.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU starts SA; initializes PHY/MAC, TDD, numerology μ=1, `N_RB 106`, n78, SIB1 and ServingCellConfigCommon consistent with config.
- DU attempts F1AP association to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` with `Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...` loops.
- DU prints `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` and remains stalled; consequently RU/radio not activated.
- No PHY/MAC crash, no PRACH errors. The blocker is purely F1C SCTP connect refused—consistent with CU not listening because of its configuration failure.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config aligns with DU RF: DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, μ=1, `N_RB_DL 106`, TDD. Threads spawn.
- UE acts as rfsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)` connection refused.
- In OAI rfsimulator, DU (server) exposes the RF endpoint; because DU is waiting for F1 Setup Response, it does not activate radio and the rfsim server is not accepting connections. Thus UE cannot connect. This is a downstream symptom, not a UE-side misconfig.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline linkage:
  - CU fails config validation at RRC due to `drb_integrity` invalid enum → CU does not bring up F1-C SCTP listener.
  - DU cannot associate F1 to CU (`ECONNREFUSED`) → DU does not activate radio (explicitly waiting for F1 Setup Response).
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server (`127.0.0.1:4043` refused) because DU radio is not up.
- Root cause is therefore the CU configuration error on `security.drb_integrity`, not DU or UE parameters.
- Spec and OAI behavior context:
  - PDCP integrity protection controls for DRBs are CU/RRC-side configuration driving security mode and PDCP behavior (3GPP TS 38.331 RRC security configuration; PDCP per TS 38.323). OAI exposes a CU config toggle for DRB integrity; accepted values in OAI configs are `yes|no`. Any other value leads to config parse error and early abort.
- No evidence of PRACH/TDD/SIB issues; the failure occurs before radio activation due to F1 blockage cascading from CU.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix: set `cu_conf.security.drb_integrity` to a valid value, typically "no" for DRBs in OAI SA test setups (integrity often disabled on DRBs, enabled on SRBs), or "yes" if you intend to enforce integrity. Ensure it is strictly "yes" or "no".

- Minimal corrected snippets:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"  
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Expected outcome after fix:
  1) CU completes RRC/security initialization, opens F1-C SCTP listener; 2) DU F1 association succeeds; 3) DU activates radio and rfsim server; 4) UE connects to `127.0.0.1:4043`, proceeds with SSB search/PRACH; 5) RRC connection/pdu-session setup continues.

- Further validation steps:
  - Restart CU first; confirm log shows F1C ready and NGAP to AMF progresses.
  - Observe DU logs for `F1 Setup Response` and radio activation messages.
  - UE should stop printing `connect() ... errno(111)` and begin synchronization.
  - Optional: set `Asn1_verbosity: "annoying"` temporarily at CU for deeper RRC diagnostics during validation.
  - Security behavior check: In PDCP logs, verify DRB integrity behavior matches `drb_integrity` setting (expect integrity disabled on DRBs when set to "no").

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; we infer ordering from typical OAI boot sequence and message content.
- Only the CU shows the explicit configuration error; we assume OAI aborts or skips bringing up F1 listener on such errors based on observed DU `ECONNREFUSED`.
- UE log shows only rfsim connection failures; deeper RRC/PDCP traces are unavailable until DU and CU come up.
- The analysis relies on OAI config schema behavior for `drb_integrity` valid values (`yes|no`), corroborated by the CU error line provided.
