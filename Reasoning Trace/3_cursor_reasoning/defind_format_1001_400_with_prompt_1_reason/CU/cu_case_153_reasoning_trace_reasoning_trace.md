### 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- **Scenario**: OAI NR SA with `--rfsim --sa`. Components: CU, DU, UE. Expected bring-up: process init → F1-C between DU↔CU → CU↔AMF NGAP ready → DU activates radio/RFsim server → UE connects to RFsim → SSB detect → RACH → RRC → PDU session.
- **Guiding clue (misconfigured_param)**: `gNBs.plmn_list.mcc=9999999` in CU config.
- **Immediate expectation**: OAI config validator should reject MCC outside 0–999 (3GPP PLMN MCC is 3-digit). CU likely exits early; DU cannot complete F1 setup; UE cannot connect to RFsim server since DU keeps radio deactivated until F1 Setup is done.

Parsed network_config highlights:
- **CU `gnb_conf`**: `plmn_list.mcc=9999999` (invalid), `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2`, F1: CU at `127.0.0.5` ↔ DU at `127.0.0.3`, NG interfaces set (AMF `192.168.70.132`).
- **DU `gnb_conf`**: PLMN `mcc=1`, `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2` (interprets as MCC 001, MNC 01); radio config shows n78, 106 PRBs, TDD config, PRACH index 98.
- **UE `ue_conf`**: IMSI `001010000000001` → PLMN 001/01, matches DU. Frequency 3619.2 MHz inferred from logs.

Initial mismatch assessment:
- CU’s PLMN is invalid by range and inconsistent with DU/UE PLMN (001/01). This single config error can abort CU initialization and cascade failures to DU/UE.

### 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU starts and parses config:
  - `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: mcc: 9999999 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999`
  - `[ENB_APP][CONFIG] ... 1 parameters with wrong value`
  - `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`
- No NGAP/F1AP progress is logged; CU terminates during config exec-check.
- Cross-check: Matches misconfigured MCC; expected behavior per OAI config checker.

Conclusion: **CU exits early due to invalid MCC**; it never listens for F1-C on `127.0.0.5:500/501`.

### 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC/TDD config successfully; prepares F1AP:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated: `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` → `F1AP ... retrying...`
  - `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`
- Interpretation: Since CU exited, its F1-C endpoint is down; DU retries SCTP and does not activate radio/RU. RF timing threads are created, but radio activation is gated on F1 Setup Response.

Conclusion: **DU is healthy but blocked by missing CU**; radio remains inactive.

### 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE config is consistent with band/numerology: DL 3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, mu=1.
- RFsim client behavior:
  - `Running as client` and repeated `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)`
- Interpretation: In OAI rfsimulator, the DU typically acts as the server side. Because DU keeps radio deactivated until F1 Setup Response, the RFsim server is not accepting connections, so the UE cannot connect.

Conclusion: **UE cannot attach to rfsim because DU has not activated radio**, which is in turn blocked by CU failure.

### 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU aborts at config check → F1-C socket not listening.
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect → no F1 Setup Response → radio not activated.
  - UE’s RFsim client cannot connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` → errno 111 (connection refused).
- Root cause guided by misconfigured_param: **Invalid CU PLMN MCC (9999999)** violates allowed [0..999] and 3GPP 3-digit MCC requirement; OAI config validator aborts. This single misconfiguration causes the entire stack to fail.

No further PRACH/PHY issues are implicated; DU/UE radio parameters appear internally consistent with n78 test setup. The PLMN mismatch with UE (001/01) would also prevent registration if CU had started, but here the fatal error is the invalid MCC value that stops CU at boot.

### 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Immediate fix: Set CU PLMN MCC to match DU/UE’s PLMN and within valid range. Use MCC `1` with `mnc_length=2` to represent `001/01` (OAI prints leading zeros per length), or explicitly set `mcc=1` and keep `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2`.
- After fix, re-run CU, verify:
  - CU completes config check, starts F1AP listener.
  - DU succeeds F1 Setup and activates radio; RFsim server starts.
  - UE connects to RFsim server, proceeds with SSB detection and RA.
- Optional hygiene checks:
  - Ensure CU’s NG interface IPs are reachable to AMF (but unrelated to the current failure).
  - Keep DU and UE PLMN aligned with CU (001/01) for successful registration.

      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Restart CU → confirm no `[CONFIG] ... invalid value` messages.
- Observe DU F1AP connects, `F1 Setup Response` received, then `activating radio` logs.
- UE should connect to RFsim server without errno 111; expect SSB found and RA.

### 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; analysis infers standard OAI sequencing.
- The exact RFsim server enablement timing is inferred from DU’s "waiting for F1 Setup Response" gating of radio activation.
- Spec grounding: MCC must be 3 digits (3GPP identifiers); OAI config checker enforces 0–999. No external queries were required given explicit validator error in logs.
