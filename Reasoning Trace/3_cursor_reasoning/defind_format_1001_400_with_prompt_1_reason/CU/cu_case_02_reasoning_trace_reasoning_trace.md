## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI NR SA with RFsim (logs show "--rfsim --sa"). Expected bring-up: CU initializes, connects to AMF (NGAP) and awaits DU over F1-C; DU initializes PHY/MAC and attempts F1AP association to CU; once F1 Setup completes, DU activates radio and RFsim server, then UE connects to RFsim, performs SSB detection, PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session. The primary class of issues in such setups are configuration validation failures at startup, inter-component parameter mismatches (e.g., TAC/PLMN, PRACH, SSB frequency), transport connectivity failures (SCTP for F1/NGAP), and PHY scheduling inconsistencies.

From network_config:
- CU `gNBs.tracking_area_code = 65535` (misconfigured_param). OAI logs explicitly flag it as invalid: authorized range 1..65533. DU `tracking_area_code = 1` (valid). PLMN aligns (MCC/MNC 1/1) on both CU and DU.
- RF band and numerology align across DU and UE: Band 78, DL center ≈ 3619.2 MHz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106.

Immediate mismatch: CU TAC 65535 invalid. This is consistent with CU logs showing config range check failure and immediate exit. Anticipated downstream effects: DU cannot establish F1-C to CU (SCTP connection refused), DU will not activate radio, so RFsim server will not accept connections; UE will fail to connect to RFsim at 127.0.0.1:4043.

Conclusion at setup: Guided by misconfigured_param, the root cause should be CU-side configuration validation failure due to invalid TAC, cascading into DU F1AP retry loop and UE RFsim connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode/version: SA mode, RFsim enabled, develop build. RAN context shows no L1/MAC/RU instances at CU (as expected for CU in split F1 mode).
- Configuration error:
  - `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 65535 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533`
  - `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`
  - `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`

Interpretation: OAI CU performs config validation and aborts on out-of-range TAC. The check matches OAI constraints that disallow 65534/65535 (reserved values), and often 0 as well.

Cross-reference with `cu_conf`:
- `tracking_area_code` indeed set to 65535, matching the flagged error. Other CU transport params (F1-C local 127.0.0.5, remote DU 127.0.0.3) are reasonable and match DU’s view.

State: CU exits before binding SCTP and F1AP; thus any DU attempt to associate will receive connection refused.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly: antenna ports, TDD pattern, numerology μ=1, N_RB 106, DL/UL freq 3619200000 Hz. ServingCellConfigCommon printed (SSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz). SIB1 params present. No PHY asserts or PRACH errors; DU is healthy.
- F1AP bring-up sequence:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by `F1AP retrying...`
  - `GNB_APP waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`

Interpretation: DU cannot connect to CU because CU is down due to configuration abort. Consequently, DU never receives F1 Setup Response and will not transition to active radio state. In OAI, RFsim server activation is gated behind successful CU-DU bring-up; hence RFsim listener will not be serving UE connections.

Link to gNB parameters: DU `tracking_area_code = 1` is valid and standard for local setups; the mismatch is not the cause per se—CU is simply invalid and down.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes with μ=1, N_RB_DL=106, DL center 3619200000 Hz, consistent with DU.
- RFsim client behavior:
  - `Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side`
  - Repeated failures: `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)`

Interpretation: The UE cannot connect to the RFsim server because the DU has not activated radio / RFsim server, which is contingent on F1 Setup with CU. This is a downstream symptom of the CU abort caused by invalid TAC.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  1) CU aborts at config validation due to `tracking_area_code=65535` (explicit log evidence).
  2) DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect to CU (connection refused), waits for F1 Setup Response, and never activates radio.
  3) UE endlessly retries RFsim TCP to 127.0.0.1:4043 and fails with ECONNREFUSED, because RFsim server is not listening until DU is active.

- Root cause: Misconfigured CU `tracking_area_code` set to 65535. Per 3GPP TS 23.003 the TAC is a 16-bit field where certain values are reserved; OAI enforces a valid range of 1..65533, rejecting 65534 and 65535 (and typically 0). The CU therefore exits at startup, cascading into DU/UE failures.

- Hypothesis confirmation: The misconfigured_param matches the CU log’s exact validation error and explains all downstream symptoms in DU and UE logs. No additional PHY or spec anomalies are needed to explain the behavior.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Immediate fix: Set CU `gNBs.tracking_area_code` to a valid value, preferably aligned with DU (1). This satisfies OAI’s config validation and ensures CU stays up, allowing F1AP association and DU radio activation, which in turn allows the UE to connect to RFsim and proceed with attach.

- Suggested corrected configuration snippets:

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "tracking_area_code": 1
      // Changed from 65535 → 1 to satisfy OAI range (1..65533)
      // and to match DU's TAC for consistent SIB/NG setup
    }
  }
}
```

UE config does not require changes for this issue; PLMN and RF parameters are already consistent with DU. Optional checks once TAC is fixed:
- Verify CU binds NGAP and connects to AMF (if AMF is reachable per `NETWORK_INTERFACES` settings). For pure RFsim functional tests without core, ensure NGAP logs are appropriately handled or disabled if running no-core scenarios.
- Observe DU logs for successful F1 Setup, RF activation, and RFsim server listening.
- Observe UE for successful RFsim TCP connection, SSB detection, PRACH, and RRC connection establishment.

- Additional diagnostics if issues persist after fixing TAC:
  - Confirm CU/DU F1 IP/port pairing: DU connects to 127.0.0.5, CU listens on 127.0.0.5; ports (500/501) align.
  - Ensure only one CU instance is using the F1-C port.
  - If AMF connectivity is required, verify `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF` and routing to AMF IP (`192.168.70.132`).

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial and without explicit timestamps, but contain decisive validation errors and repeated SCTP refusals that clearly indicate the sequence of failures.
- The analysis assumes standard OAI behavior gating RFsim activation on successful F1 Setup; this matches typical OAI sequences in RFsim SA deployments.
- Spec reference is summarized from common knowledge: TAC values 0xFFFE and 0xFFFF are reserved; OAI enforces 1..65533. If needed, consult 3GPP TS 23.003 and OAI config validation code for exact constraints.
