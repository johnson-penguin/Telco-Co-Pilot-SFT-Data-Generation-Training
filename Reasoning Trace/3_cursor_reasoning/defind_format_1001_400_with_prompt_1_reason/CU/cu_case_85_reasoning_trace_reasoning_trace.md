## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- Running OAI NR SA with rfsim: command lines show "--rfsim --sa"; DU starts normally, UE is rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU parses config → NGAP setup to AMF → CU starts F1AP server and GTP-U listener → DU connects F1-C to CU and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio (rfsim server) → UE connects to server → SSB/PRACH → RRC attach.
- Provided misconfigured_param: Asn1_verbosity=None (capitalized "None"). In OAI configs, `Asn1_verbosity` is typically a string enum like "none"/"info"/"annoying". Using an invalid/unquoted or wrong-cased token can break libconfig parsing.
- Network config parsing (relevant):
  - CU `gNBs` shows proper F1 addresses (127.0.0.5 for CU, 127.0.0.3 for DU) and NG interfaces 192.168.8.43. `Asn1_verbosity` field is not shown in the provided `cu_conf` object but the error case’s file (`cu_case_84.conf`) evidently contained `Asn1_verbosity=None` at line 4, causing parse failure.
  - DU config is healthy; it proceeds to F1AP and attempts SCTP to CU 127.0.0.5. UE repeatedly attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Early fatal errors:
  - "[LIBCONFIG] ... line 4: syntax error" and "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded" → configuration parsing failed; the module returns -1.
  - Subsequent messages: "log_config skipped", "init aborted", "Getting configuration failed", and the init function `config_libconfig_init` returned -1.
- Interpretation: CU never initializes its runtime because libconfig failed to parse the configuration file. This occurs before any NGAP/F1AP sockets are set up. The most plausible cause, guided by `misconfigured_param`, is the invalid token/value `Asn1_verbosity=None` near the top of the file (line 4).

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU brings up PHY/MAC and prepares TDD with normal parameters; no PHY errors.
- Networking:
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" indicates proper DU-side addressing.
  - Repeated "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" show the DU cannot complete F1 because the CU never created the SCTP listener (CU failed during config parsing).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes and repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043; all attempts fail with errno(111).
- Because DU is waiting for F1 Setup Response, it never activates the rfsim server; hence, no listener exists for the UE to connect to.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence:
  - CU fails at config parsing due to `Asn1_verbosity=None` (invalid token/value) at line 4.
  - DU attempts F1 SCTP to CU and is refused, since CU process never initialized networking.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server because DU hasn’t activated radio without F1 Setup.
- Root cause:
  - Misconfigured parameter `Asn1_verbosity=None` in CU config is syntactically invalid for libconfig and/or semantically invalid for OAI’s expected enum. OAI expects quoted lower-case string values (e.g., "none", "info", "annoying"). Using capitalized `None` without quotes makes libconfig treat it as an identifier (and not a known symbol), yielding a syntax error. Even quoted "None" would be invalid semantically.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Configuration corrections (CU):
  - Set `Asn1_verbosity` to a valid, quoted value such as "none" or align with DU’s verbosity if desired. Example fix uses "none" to minimize ASN.1 logging.
  - Re-run CU; verify configuration is accepted and CU proceeds to start F1AP and NGAP.
- Corrected snippets (JSON-style within `network_config` structure; comments indicate changes):
```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "Asn1_verbosity": "none",  // FIX: was None; must be a valid quoted enum string
    "gNBs": {
      "tr_s_preference": "f1",
      "local_s_if_name": "lo",
      "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
      "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3",
      "local_s_portc": 501,
      "local_s_portd": 2152,
      "remote_s_portc": 500,
      "remote_s_portd": 2152,
      "SCTP": { "SCTP_INSTREAMS": 2, "SCTP_OUTSTREAMS": 2 },
      "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
        "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
      }
    }
  },
  "du_conf": {
    "Asn1_verbosity": "annoying"  // optional: keep or harmonize with CU per logging preference
  }
}
```
- Operational checks post-fix:
  - CU logs should no longer show libconfig syntax error; `config_libconfig_init` should return 0.
  - DU should show successful SCTP association and F1 Setup Response; radio activates and rfsim server listens on 4043.
  - UE should succeed connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceed to SSB detection and RA.
- If issues persist:
  - Validate the exact allowed values for `Asn1_verbosity` in your OAI build (typical: "none" | "info" | "annoying").
  - Ensure the parameter is placed at the correct scope near the top-level of the CU config and is properly quoted per libconfig syntax.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated (no timestamps); inference relies on OAI’s typical startup sequence.
- The exact CU `cu_case_84.conf` isn’t shown; analysis assumes the misconfigured `Asn1_verbosity=None` appears at line 4 causing the parser error.
- No radio parameter issues were analyzed since CU failed before F1; if still failing after fix, proceed to check F1 addressing and PRACH/TDD consistency.
