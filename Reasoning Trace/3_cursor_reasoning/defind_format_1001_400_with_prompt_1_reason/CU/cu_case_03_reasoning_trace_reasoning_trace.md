## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI NR SA with RFsim (logs show "--rfsim --sa"). Expected bring-up: CU initializes, connects to AMF (NGAP) and awaits DU over F1-C; DU initializes PHY/MAC and attempts F1AP association to CU; once F1 Setup completes, DU activates radio and RFsim server, then UE connects to RFsim, performs SSB detection, PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session. Typical issues: config validation errors, inter-component parameter mismatches (PLMN/TAC), transport failures (SCTP for F1/NGAP), and PHY scheduling inconsistencies.

From network_config:
- CU PLMN is set to MCC/MNC = 999/01 (misconfigured_param), while DU advertises 001/01 and UE IMSI starts with 00101... indicating PLMN 001/01.
- TAC is 1 on both CU and DU (valid). RF band and numerology align (Band 78, DL ≈ 3619.2 MHz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106).

Initial mismatch: PLMN. CU PLMN 999/01 conflicts with DU and UE PLMN 001/01. Expect F1 Setup to fail due to PLMN mismatch, preventing DU activation and keeping RFsim unavailable for UE.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts NGAP, sends NGSetupRequest, briefly shows an NG setup failure then a response (likely from previous/parallel AMF state, not essential here). CU then starts F1AP and receives DU F1 Setup Request.
- Critical line: `[NR_RRC]   PLMN mismatch: CU 999.01, DU 00101` followed by SCTP shutdown and F1 endpoint removal.

Cross-reference with `cu_conf`:
- `plmn_list.mcc = 999`, `mnc = 1`, which encodes as 999.01. This directly matches the CU log and the misconfigured_param.
- Transport params and ports are consistent with DU (127.0.0.5/127.0.0.3, ports 500/501/2152) and are not the source of failure.

State: CU rejects F1 Setup due to PLMN mismatch and tears down the SCTP association.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC normally: antenna ports, TDD pattern, numerology, SSB frequency consistent with UE.
- F1AP: starts and attempts to connect to CU at 127.0.0.5. After exchange, DU reports: `[MAC] the CU reported F1AP Setup Failure, is there a configuration mismatch?` This correlates with the CU’s PLMN mismatch rejection.
- No PRACH/MAC/PHY asserts are observed; failure occurs at control-plane configuration consistency stage (F1 Setup), not at PHY.

Link to `du_conf`:
- DU `plmn_list` MCC/MNC = 001/01, matching the printed DU banner `MCC/MNC/length 1/1/2` and the CU’s mismatch message `DU 00101`.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE RF and numerology align with DU; however, repeated RFsim TCP connection failures to 127.0.0.1:4043 (ECONNREFUSED) indicate the RFsim server is not accepting connections.
- Since DU did not complete F1 Setup with CU, it does not activate the radio chain and RFsim server listener, leading to the UE’s persistent connection refusals.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence:
  1) CU with PLMN 999/01 receives DU F1 Setup request advertising 001/01.
  2) CU detects PLMN mismatch and rejects F1 Setup; SCTP association is shut down.
  3) DU reports F1AP Setup Failure; radio not activated; RFsim server remains down.
  4) UE fails to connect to RFsim (ECONNREFUSED) because DU radio never activated.

- Root cause: CU `plmn_list.mcc=999` (with `mnc=1`) causing PLMN mismatch with DU/UE PLMN 001/01. This is explicitly logged by CU `[NR_RRC] PLMN mismatch: CU 999.01, DU 00101` and explains the F1 Setup failure and downstream UE symptoms.

- No further PHY or timing anomalies are needed to explain the failure; the misconfigured_param fully accounts for the observed behavior.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Immediate fix: Align CU PLMN with DU/UE. Set CU `plmn_list.mcc` to 1 (and keep `mnc=1`, `mnc_length=2`).

Corrected configuration snippet:

```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "plmn_list": {
        "mcc": 1,
        "mnc": 1,
        "mnc_length": 2,
        "snssaiList": { "sst": 1 }
      }
      // Changed MCC from 999 → 1 to match DU/UE PLMN 001/01
    }
  }
}
```

Post-fix validation steps:
- Confirm CU accepts F1 Setup and DU logs transition to active radio with RFsim listener up.
- Verify UE connects to RFsim TCP, detects SSB, performs PRACH, and proceeds with RRC attach.
- If using core network, ensure AMF registration is stable; the earlier NG setup failure message should not persist after consistent PLMN.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs lack timestamps and are partial, but include explicit PLMN mismatch messaging that decisively indicates the root cause.
- The unusual NG setup failure followed by response at CU appears transient or unrelated to the F1 PLMN mismatch; resolving PLMN alignment should not exacerbate NGAP.
- Analysis grounded in OAI’s F1 Setup checks for PLMN consistency and observed log lines; spec references (e.g., PLMN formatting and identity consistency across nodes) are standard behavior in 5G systems.
