## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- Scenario: OAI SA with `--rfsim --sa`. Components: CU (F1-C/SCTP server to DU, NGAP to AMF), DU (F1-C client to CU, rfsimulator server), UE (rfsimulator client to DU).
- Expected flow: CU loads config → initializes RRC/NGAP → starts F1-C server → DU connects via F1-C and activates radio/rfsim → UE connects to rfsim → SSB detection/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter (given): `security.ciphering_algorithms[1]=nea9` in CU config. OAI supports `nea0`, `nea1`, `nea2`, `nea3`. `nea9` is unknown and rejected by RRC config validation.
- Network config (parsed):
  - CU: `gNBs.local_s_address=127.0.0.5`, `remote_s_address=127.0.0.3`; `security.ciphering_algorithms=["nea3","nea9","nea1","nea0"]` (offending second entry); integrity `["nia2","nia0"]`.
  - DU: n78, µ=1, N_RB=106, PRACH index 98; F1-C target CU `127.0.0.5`; rfsimulator server `4043`.
  - UE: SIM credentials only; UE logs show repeated rfsim connect attempts to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Initial cues:
  - CU log: `[RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9" in section "security"` while reading config sections; `config_libconfig_init returned 0` (syntactic parse OK; semantic validation fails later in RRC).
  - DU: repeated F1 `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` to `127.0.0.5`; waiting for F1 Setup Response.
  - UE: repeated rfsim connection refusals (errno 111), typical when DU has not activated radio due to missing F1 setup.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode and CU role (`RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0`), prints CU identity.
- Critical error: `unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9"` during security config processing.
- Since security configuration is part of RRC setup, this prevents CU from completing RRC initialization and from starting F1-C listener and NGAP procedures.
- Impact: CU is not listening on F1-C (127.0.0.5:501), causing DU connection refusals.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC and serving cell (SSB abs freq 641280 → 3619.2 MHz, n78; TDD pattern OK).
- F1AP client attempts to CU `127.0.0.5` repeatedly; `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused`; DU stays in `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- Conclusion: DU is healthy but blocked by CU not providing F1-C service due to CU config error.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes at 3.6192 GHz, µ=1, N_RB=106 consistent with DU.
- Acts as rfsimulator client, repeatedly trying `127.0.0.1:4043` and failing with `errno(111)`.
- Explanation: DU hasn’t activated radio nor started the rfsim server because F1 Setup with CU never completed.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence:
  - CU fails RRC initialization due to unsupported `nea9` in `security.ciphering_algorithms`.
  - F1/NGAP services are not started → DU’s SCTP connect attempts to 127.0.0.5 are refused.
  - DU remains pre-activation → rfsim server not listening → UE connection attempts fail.
- Root cause: Invalid ciphering algorithm token `nea9` in CU security configuration. OAI supports only `nea0/1/2/3`; any other value is rejected, aborting RRC bring-up.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix (CU): replace `nea9` with a supported algorithm and maintain a strong-to-weak order, e.g., `["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"]`.
- No changes needed on DU/UE for this issue.
- After fixing:
  - Verify CU logs show successful RRC init and F1AP server bind on `127.0.0.5` and NGAP init to AMF.
  - Confirm DU receives F1 Setup Response and activates radio; rfsim server starts on `127.0.0.1:4043`.
  - UE should connect to rfsim and proceed with SSB/PRACH and RRC.
- Corrected configuration snippets (within provided `network_config` structure):
```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "security": {
      "ciphering_algorithms": [
        "nea3",
        "nea2",
        "nea1",
        "nea0"
      ],
      "integrity_algorithms": [
        "nia2",
        "nia0"
      ],
      "drb_ciphering": "yes",
      "drb_integrity": "no"
    }
  }
}
```
- Additional checks:
  - Ensure no duplicate/legacy security blocks conflict; keep a single authoritative `security` block.
  - If still failing, enable higher `rrc_log_level` and check for subsequent security capability negotiation with UEs.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial and without timestamps; ordering inferred from OAI behavior.
- `config_libconfig_init returned 0` confirms syntactic parsing; the actual operational failure is semantic validation at RRC security setup.
- No 3GPP spec lookups required; issue is implementation support of algorithm identifiers rather than radio procedures.
