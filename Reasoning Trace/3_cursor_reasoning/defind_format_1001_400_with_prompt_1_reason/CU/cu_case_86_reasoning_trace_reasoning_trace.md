## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- OAI NR SA with rfsim: command lines show "--rfsim --sa"; DU initializes normally and tries to connect F1-C to CU; UE is rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected sequence: CU parses config → NGAP setup → CU starts F1AP/GTP-U (F1-U) → DU connects via SCTP to CU, completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio (starts rfsim server) → UE connects and proceeds with RA/RRC.
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.tr_s_preference=None` in CU config (`cu_case_85.conf`). In OAI, `tr_s_preference` selects the split/transport mode (e.g., "f1", "local_L1"). Using an unrecognized token (and unquoted) causes libconfig parse errors.
- Provided network_config shows healthy references (CU local 127.0.0.5, DU 127.0.0.3; NG interfaces set), and a valid `Asn1_verbosity`.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Fatal early errors:
  - "[LIBCONFIG] ... line 31: syntax error", then "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded" and "init aborted"; `config_libconfig_init` returned -1.
- Interpretation: CU fails to parse the configuration file and aborts, before setting up NGAP/F1AP. Guided by `misconfigured_param`, the likely culprit is `gNBs.tr_s_preference=None` around line 31. In libconfig syntax, enums must be valid strings (quoted); `None` is neither quoted nor a valid value.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU starts PHY/MAC successfully, configures TDD and reads serving cell config; no PHY issues reported.
- Networking:
  - DU attempts F1-C to CU: "connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5".
  - Repeated "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and "waiting for F1 Setup Response" → CU listener not present due to CU abort during config parsing.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE repeatedly attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 with errno(111). This is because the DU never activates the rfsim server without a successful F1 Setup with CU.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence correlation:
  - CU parse failure at `gNBs.tr_s_preference=None` prevents CU startup and F1 listener creation.
  - DU cannot establish SCTP association; stays in retry loop and does not activate radio.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server; connection refused.
- Root cause:
  - Invalid value and syntax for `tr_s_preference` in CU. OAI expects a valid quoted string (e.g., "f1"). Unquoted `None` is a syntax error; even quoted "None" would be semantically invalid, as it is not a supported option.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Configuration corrections (CU):
  - Set `gNBs.tr_s_preference` to a valid quoted value; for a CU in CU/DU split, use "f1". Ensure the DU `tr_n_preference` is "f1" (already is) and addressing remains consistent.
- Corrected snippets (JSON-style within `network_config` with comments for clarity):
```json
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "tr_s_preference": "f1",  // FIX: was None; must be a valid quoted string
      "local_s_if_name": "lo",
      "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5",
      "remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3",
      "local_s_portc": 501,
      "local_s_portd": 2152,
      "remote_s_portc": 500,
      "remote_s_portd": 2152,
      "SCTP": { "SCTP_INSTREAMS": 2, "SCTP_OUTSTREAMS": 2 },
      "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43",
        "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43",
        "GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U": 2152
      }
    }
  },
  "du_conf": {
    "MACRLCs": [
      {
        "tr_n_preference": "f1",  // already correct
        "local_n_address": "127.0.0.3",
        "remote_n_address": "127.0.0.5",
        "local_n_portc": 500,
        "local_n_portd": 2152,
        "remote_n_portc": 501,
        "remote_n_portd": 2152
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
- Post-fix validation:
  - CU should parse config successfully (no libconfig errors), initialize NGAP and F1AP.
  - DU should create SCTP association and receive F1 Setup Response, then start the rfsim server on 4043.
  - UE should connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceed to SSB/RA.
- If issues persist:
  - Confirm other top-level tokens are quoted (libconfig requires strings in quotes). Valid `tr_s_preference` options include at least "f1" and for monolithic cases may involve local splits; verify against your OAI version.
  - Check CU/DU addressing consistency and reachability.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and not timestamped; ordering is inferred from OAI behavior.
- The exact `cu_case_85.conf` is not shown; analysis assumes the provided misconfiguration appears around the reported line and triggers libconfig syntax error.
- Radio/PRACH-level checks are unnecessary here because CU fails before F1; pursue those only if F1 succeeds and issues remain.
