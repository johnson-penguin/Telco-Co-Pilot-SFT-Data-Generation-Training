## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR Standalone with `rfsim` (logs show "--rfsim --sa"). Expected flow: CU boots (NGAP ready), DU boots and establishes F1-C to CU, DU starts rfsimulator server, UE connects to rfsim server, performs PRACH/RA, RRC setup, and PDU session. The provided `misconfigured_param` is `security.ciphering_algorithms[0]=0` in CU config. OAI expects NR ciphering algorithm names (`nea0`, `nea1`, `nea2`), not numeric "0"; placing "0" first breaks parsing and can prevent CU from fully activating RRC/NGAP.

From network_config:
- gNB CU (`cu_conf.gNBs`): `tr_s_preference: f1`, F1-C `local_s_address 127.0.0.5` to DU `remote_s_address 127.0.0.3`; NGAP/NGU on `192.168.8.43`, AMF `192.168.70.132`.
- CU security: `ciphering_algorithms: ["0", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"]`, `integrity_algorithms: ["nia2","nia0"]`, `drb_ciphering: yes`, `drb_integrity: no`.
- DU (`du_conf`): NR78 at 3619.2 MHz DL/UL, TDD config, PRACH index 98 (valid for µ=1), F1-C DU IP `127.0.0.3` to CU `127.0.0.5`, rfsimulator server at port 4043.
- UE: SIM params present; RFSIM client attempts to connect `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial mismatch: CU logs explicitly warn about unknown ciphering algorithm "0" under `security`. This aligns with the misconfigured parameter and likely prevents CU completion. DU and UE appear nominal but blocked by CU not serving F1-C/rfsim.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA mode, prints build info, initializes minimal RAN context for CU-split (no L1/L2 instances).
- Critical anomaly: `[RRC]   unknown ciphering algorithm "0" in section "security" of the configuration file` right after CU app initialization.
- After this, only config reading messages appear; no evidence of NGAP init, F1-C listener, or AMF connection. Typical healthy CU logs would show NGAP SCTP client to AMF, F1AP endpoint, and RRC setup. Their absence indicates early configuration error handling aborted further initialization or left CU in a non-operational state.
- Cross-reference: `cu_conf.security.ciphering_algorithms[0]` is indeed string "0". OAI CU's RRC/NAS security setup enumerates NEA algorithms by names; invalid literal causes rejection.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly for NR78 µ=1, 106 PRBs, TDD pattern consistent with config.
- DU attempts F1-C: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` then repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused`. This means CU is either not listening on F1-C, or failed to start F1 service due to its config error.
- DU logs: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` — radio activation (and by extension the rfsim server side) is deferred until F1 is established. Therefore, without CU, DU never starts the rfsim server for the UE to connect to.
- No PHY/MAC crash signatures (no PRACH/DMRS asserts). DU is healthy but blocked by missing CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY with DL/UL at 3619.2 MHz, µ=1, TDD — all matching DU config.
- UE runs as rfsim client and repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, failing with `errno(111)` (connection refused). This occurs because the DU has not started the rfsim server yet, as it is awaiting F1 Setup to the CU.
- No higher-layer activity (no SSB sync/RA) because there is no RF link established in rfsim without the server.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU hits security config error and does not bring up F1-C/NGAP.
  - DU tries F1-C to CU (`127.0.0.5`) and gets connection refused repeatedly; it defers radio activation.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim `127.0.0.1:4043` because DU never starts the server (no F1 Setup completion).
- Misconfigured parameter drives the failure: `security.ciphering_algorithms[0]=0` is invalid for OAI. OAI expects `nea0/nea1/nea2` strings as the set and order of preference. Using a bare "0" causes `[RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm` and prevents CU RRC/NAS security configuration, blocking the CU startup pipeline that includes F1-C setup.
- Standards alignment: 3GPP TS 33.501 defines NR ciphering algorithms as 128-NEA0/1/2. OAI config maps to `nea0/nea1/nea2` labels. Numeric "0" is not a valid token in OAI configuration.

Conclusion: The root cause is the invalid ciphering algorithm entry at the first position in CU security config, which prevents CU from becoming operational, cascading to DU F1-C failures and UE rfsim connection refusals.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix (CU `security` block):
- Replace the invalid "0" with a valid NEA string and ensure a sensible preference order. Common robust order: `["nea2","nea1","nea0"]`.
- Optionally add `nia1` to integrity preferences if needed by AMF/network, but current `nia2/nia0` is acceptable.

Post-fix expected behavior:
- CU completes RRC/NAS security setup, brings up F1-C and NGAP.
- DU connects F1-C, receives F1 Setup Response, activates radio and starts rfsim server at 4043.
- UE connects to rfsim server, proceeds with SSB detection, PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session.

Corrected config snippets (focused deltas), embedded under the same `network_config` structure:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": [
          "nea2",
          "nea1",
          "nea0"
        ],
        "integrity_algorithms": [
          "nia2",
          "nia0"
        ],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes",
        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server",
        "serverport": 4043,
        "options": [],
        "modelname": "AWGN",
        "IQfile": "/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsim": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- CU: The only necessary change is fixing `ciphering_algorithms`; keeping `drb_integrity: no` is typical for OAI demos but can be set to `yes` if end-to-end integrity is required and AMF supports it.
- DU/UE: No functional change required for this issue; rfsim parameters already align. UE block is shown only to make the implicit rfsim client settings explicit.

Additional validation steps:
- After applying the CU fix, observe CU logs for successful NGAP SCTP association to AMF and F1AP ready.
- Observe DU logs for `F1 Setup Response` and radio activation, followed by rfsim server start.
- Observe UE logs for successful TCP connection to 4043, SSB synchronization, RA procedure, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial (no CU NGAP/F1 traces post-error; no DU radio start; UE shows only rfsim TCP attempts). Timing alignment is inferred.
- The analysis assumes standard OAI behavior where invalid security algorithm tokens abort or gate higher-layer initialization; this is consistent with the observed CU error log.
- No external tool queries were required; behavior matches known OAI config parsing and 3GPP naming for NEA/NIA algorithms.
