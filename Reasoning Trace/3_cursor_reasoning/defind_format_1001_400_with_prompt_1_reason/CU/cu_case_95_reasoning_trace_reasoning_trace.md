## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

We analyze an OAI 5G NR Standalone setup using the RF simulator. Expected bring-up: CU starts and exposes NGAP/F1-C → DU starts, performs F1-Setup with CU, then activates radio and rfsim server → UE starts and connects as rfsim client, detects SSB, performs PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session.

Guiding clue (misconfigured_param): "log_config.rrc_log_level=None" in the CU config. OAI log levels must be valid strings among {error, warn, info, debug, trace}. Using "None" is invalid for libconfig and typically yields a parse error. The CU logs show a libconfig syntax error and abort. That prevents F1-Setup; the DU keeps retrying SCTP to CU; with no F1-Setup, the DU does not activate radio nor the rfsimulator server, so the UE cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and loops with ECONNREFUSED.

Network configuration summary (extracted):
- CU `gNB_name` "gNB-Eurecom-CU"; F1-C loopback pair: CU `local_s_address` 127.0.0.5 ↔ DU `remote_n_address` 127.0.0.5; DU local `127.0.0.3`. Ports align (CU `local_s_portc` 501, DU `local_n_portc` 500; cross-remote ports 500/501). AMF at `192.168.70.132`. CU `log_config` in provided JSON lists `rlc_log_level`, `pdcp_log_level`, `ngap_log_level`, `f1ap_log_level` all as "info"; `rrc_log_level` is not present here but exists in the failing `.conf` as `None` per misconfigured_param.
- DU config: SA, n78, SCS 30 kHz, 106 PRBs, SSB ARFCN 641280 (~3619.2 MHz). TDD pattern consistent with logs. F1AP DU → CU at 127.0.0.5. `rfsimulator.serveraddr` is "server" (DU acts as server on port 4043) and only becomes available after F1-Setup.
- UE: SIM credentials only; by logs it runs TDD at 3619.2 MHz and tries to connect to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043 as client.

Initial mismatch tied to misconfiguration: CU has `rrc_log_level=None` in the error `.conf` (cu_case_94.conf). This causes CU configuration parsing failure and abort. Consequences cascade to DU (F1-C refused) and UE (rfsim TCP refused), matching logs.

Assumptions: Single-node loopback rfsim; CU should be up before DU; DU only starts rfsim server after successful F1-Setup.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Key lines:
- "[LIBCONFIG] file .../cu_case_94.conf - line 88: syntax error"
- "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded"
- "config_get, section log_config skipped, config module not properly initialized"
- "[LOG] init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed"
- CMDLINE shows `--rfsim --sa -O .../cu_case_94.conf`.

Interpretation:
- CU fails at configuration parsing. An invalid token in `log_config` (here, `rrc_log_level=None`) is sufficient to produce a syntax or validation error and abort initialization. CU therefore never binds F1-C or NGAP and exits early.
- Cross-check to `network_config.cu_conf`: sanitized JSON has valid levels but lacks `rrc_log_level`. The failing runtime file adds it with an invalid value. Root cause is strictly in CU configuration.

Relevance to connectivity:
- With CU down, no F1-C listener exists on 127.0.0.5:500/501, so DU SCTP connections are refused.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Flow and observations:
- Normal SA init; parameters align with n78 at 3619.2 MHz; TDD pattern and bandwidth match network_config.
- F1AP: DU tries to connect to CU at 127.0.0.5; repeated "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused"; F1AP retries.
- "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" persists, so DU does not activate radio or rfsim server.

Interpretation:
- DU’s failures are secondary to CU being down. There are no PHY/MAC assertions (e.g., PRACH) indicating internal DU issues; it is strictly waiting for F1-Setup.

Parameter linkage:
- F1-C addressing/ports in DU and CU configs align; the error is not IP/port but CU readiness.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Key lines:
- UE RF matches n78 3619.2 MHz, SCS 30 kHz, N_RB_DL 106.
- Repeated attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 with errno(111) (ECONNREFUSED).

Interpretation:
- UE acts as rfsim client. Because the DU has not activated radio (no F1-Setup), the rfsim server is not listening, so all TCP connections fail. This is a downstream symptom of the CU misconfiguration.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU aborts due to `log_config.rrc_log_level=None` causing libconfig syntax/validation error.
- DU cannot establish F1-C; it retries and stays pre-activation, so rfsim server never starts.
- UE cannot connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 and loops with ECONNREFUSED.

Root cause:
- Invalid CU log configuration value: `rrc_log_level=None`. Valid values are the known OAI levels (error/warn/info/debug/trace). Using "None" causes config parsing to fail in libconfig.

Evidence alignment:
- CU: explicit libconfig syntax error and init abort.
- DU: repeated SCTP connection refused; waiting for F1-Setup Response.
- UE: repeated TCP refused to 4043.

External standard/code knowledge:
- OAI uses libconfig with strict enumerated strings for per-module log levels. Invalid tokens cause early parse errors. No 3GPP-specific PRACH/SIB contradiction is implicated here; the failure precedes radio activation.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Config fix:
- In the CU `.conf`, replace `log_config.rrc_log_level=None` with a valid level, e.g., `"info"` (or desired verbosity). Ensure `rrc_log_level` is present only once and is a valid token.

Operational sequence:
- Start CU and confirm it binds F1-C/NGAP without config errors → start DU and verify F1-Setup completes → observe DU activating radio and rfsim server → start UE and confirm TCP connect success to 127.0.0.1:4043, SSB detection, PRACH, and RRC attach.

Post-fix validation checkpoints:
- CU logs: no libconfig error; F1AP and NGAP initialized.
- DU logs: SCTP connects, "Received F1 Setup Response", then radio activation; rfsim server bound to port 4043.
- UE logs: successful TCP connect; synchronization and RA procedures proceed.

Optional hygiene:
- Keep all CU `log_config` entries to valid values; avoid Python literals like `None`.
- If desired for clarity, set DU `rfsimulator.serveraddr` to `"127.0.0.1"`; not required for this root cause.

Corrected configuration snippets (JSON within `network_config` structure):

```json

  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        "global_log_level": "info",

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. Limitations

- The provided CU JSON is sanitized and doesn’t show the erroneous `rrc_log_level`; the failure stems from the separate runtime file (`cu_case_94.conf`).
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; ordering is inferred from OAI’s typical behavior.
- No external spec lookup was needed since the fault is in config parsing, not radio procedures.
