## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The run is OAI NR SA using RFsim (`--rfsim --sa`). Expected sequence: CU/DU start → F1AP association → DU radio activation → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB detection → RACH → RRC setup → PDU session.
- Key misconfiguration provided: **security.drb_ciphering=invalid_enum_value** (CU). CU log explicitly flags: RRC config file error “bad drb_ciphering value 'invalid_enum_value', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed”. This parameter governs whether DRB (user plane PDCP) ciphering is enabled on the gNB side.
- Network config parsing:
  - CU (`cu_conf.gNBs`): F1-C CU IP `127.0.0.5`, F1-C DU IP `127.0.0.3`; NGU/S1U ports `2152`; AMF IPv4 `192.168.70.132`; `security.drb_ciphering` set to invalid value; `drb_integrity` set to `no`.
  - DU (`du_conf.gNBs[0]`): PRACH index 98 (valid for μ=1), band 78, N_RB 106, TDD config consistent with logs; F1 DU local `127.0.0.3` to CU `127.0.0.5`; RFsim server mode is configured (`rfsimulator.serveraddr: server`, port 4043) meaning DU hosts RFsim server.
  - UE: IMSI and auth material present; RF layer shows repeated attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (client), consistent with DU as server.
- Initial mismatches noted: CU complains about invalid `drb_ciphering`; DU shows repeated SCTP connect failure to CU (`Connection refused`), implying CU is not accepting F1C due to early config failure; UE cannot connect to RFsim because DU hasn’t completed F1 setup and radio activation.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode/version: SA with RFsim; build info present; CU context shows `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` because CU has no MAC/L1 (F1 split).
- CU emits: **[RRC] in configuration file, bad drb_ciphering value 'invalid_enum_value', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed** → this is a configuration validation error at CU RRC parsing time.
- After command line and config parsing, sections are read (GNBSParams, SCTP, periodic events). There are no subsequent lines confirming F1-C listener up or NGAP towards AMF. The absence of F1AP accept or NGAP progress suggests CU initialization is hindered by the invalid security parameter. In OAI, invalid config values typically cause either fatal exit or partial init without starting interfaces.
- Cross-ref with config: CU’s `security.drb_ciphering` must be `yes` or `no`. An invalid token will block proper RRC/PDCP security profile construction and may prevent F1 setup procedures from being served.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 fully: antenna ports, TDD, frequencies (DL=UL=3.6192 GHz), BW=106 PRBs, SIB1 scheduling. It proceeds to start F1AP as DU side.
- F1AP connection attempts: DU tries SCTP to CU at `127.0.0.5`, repeatedly failing with `Connection refused`. DU logs: “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio”. Hence radio activation is gated by F1 setup; RFsim server thread is created but full activation is blocked.
- No PRACH/MAC errors; PRACH and TDD parameters consistent and healthy. Therefore the DU is stalled solely due to the unresponsive CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE PHY initializes for μ=1, 106 PRBs, TDD, centered at 3.6192 GHz. It runs as RFsim client and repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)` (connection refused), meaning the RFsim server socket at the DU is not accepting connections yet.
- This aligns with the DU being blocked waiting for F1 Setup Response; without DU activation, the RFsim server never fully opens for UE connections.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU detects invalid `drb_ciphering` during config parsing and does not bring up F1-C/NGAP services.
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (`connection refused`) and remains waiting for F1 Setup Response; radio not activated.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim server (`connection refused`) since DU radio/server activation is gated on F1 setup with CU.
- Root cause tied to provided misconfigured parameter: **`security.drb_ciphering=invalid_enum_value`**. OAI expects `yes` or `no`. An invalid value blocks CU’s security setup; without CU up, F1 association is impossible, cascading to DU/UE failures.
- 3GPP context: DRB ciphering controls user plane protection at PDCP. While 3GPP allows enabling/disabling ciphering per DRB via RRC/PDCP, OAI’s config validator enforces boolean tokens. A syntactically invalid value aborts initialization before any F1/NGAP interaction.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Immediate fix: Set `security.drb_ciphering` to a valid boolean string. Choose `yes` (typical for SA testing) unless intentionally testing unencrypted DRB.
- Optional: Keep `drb_integrity` aligned with your test goals (often `no` for user plane, integrity typically on SRB/Control plane via `nia2`).
- After change, verify:
  - CU starts F1-C listener and NGAP, logs show F1AP Setup Request/Response with DU.
  - DU receives F1 Setup Response, activates radio; RFsim server begins accepting.
  - UE connects to RFsim server, detects SSB, proceeds with RACH and RRC.
- Suggested corrected snippets (JSON-style with comments):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3", "nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],
        "drb_ciphering": "yes", // changed from invalid_enum_value → valid token
        "drb_integrity": "no"    // keep as-is unless policy requires otherwise
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server", // DU hosts server
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", // UE connects to local DU server
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- If issues persist after the fix:
  - Confirm CU is binding to the expected F1-C IP/port (`127.0.0.5:501`) and DU uses matching `127.0.0.3:500` as configured.
  - Ensure no firewall/SELinux blocks SCTP on loopback.
  - Increase `Asn1_verbosity` to `annoying` on CU to observe RRC config encoding after changes.
  - Enable `f1ap_log_level=debug` and `rrc_log_level=debug` on CU/DU for detailed F1 setup traces.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack explicit CU fatal/exit lines; conclusion relies on the explicit CU error and absence of F1/NGAP bring-up afterward.
- UE config section in provided JSON does not explicitly show RFsim fields; UE logs confirm defaulting to `127.0.0.1:4043`, consistent with DU-as-server setup.
- No external spec lookup required; the failure is at configuration parsing/validation rather than a standards-level interop issue.
