## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
Based on the logs and configuration, the scenario is OAI NR SA with RF Simulator:
- CU is launched with `--rfsim --sa` and an external CU config file.
- DU is launched in SA mode, initializes PHY/MAC, sets up TDD and attempts F1-C over localhost.
- UE runs as RFsim client trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Expected SA flow: CU and DU start → F1 Setup (DU↔CU) → DU activates radio → UE connects to DU rfsim server → SSB/RACH → RRC attach and PDU session.

Input highlights:
- misconfigured_param: `log_config.mac_log_level=None`.
- CU logs show libconfig parsing failure and init abort.
- DU loops on SCTP connect refused for F1; UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server.

Parsed network_config:
- cu_conf.gNBs: F1-C CU at `127.0.0.5`, F1-C DU peer `127.0.0.3`, NGU/N2 IPs set. log_config includes `global/hw/phy/rlc/pdcp/rrc/ngap/f1ap` levels.
- du_conf.gNBs[0]: NR band n78, 106 PRBs, SCS µ=1, PRACH `prach_ConfigurationIndex=98` with valid-looking RACH params; rfsimulator server mode (`serveraddr: "server"`, port 4043). log_config includes `mac_log_level`.
- ue_conf: IMSI and credentials only (RFsim address is not in ue_conf; it’s hardcoded/CLI elsewhere in logs as 127.0.0.1:4043).

Early mismatch: The misconfigured parameter `log_config.mac_log_level=None` is not a valid log level for OAI, and CU’s `log_config` section (per cu_conf) does not define `mac_log_level` at all. If inserted or malformed in CU’s config, it can trigger libconfig syntax/type errors and abort initialization. That aligns with the CU error at config parse.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key lines:
- `[LIBCONFIG] ... line 85: syntax error`
- `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`
- `config_get, section log_config skipped, config module not properly initialized`
- `init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed`
- Command line shows CU started with the failing `.conf` file.

Interpretation:
- The CU fails during configuration parsing. A syntax or type error in the config file (very likely in or near `log_config`) causes `config_libconfig_init` to return -1. Once the config module is not initialized, all subsequent sections are skipped and CU aborts. This prevents F1-C server endpoint from being opened at `127.0.0.5:501`, making DU connections fail.

Relevance to misconfigured_param:
- If `mac_log_level=None` appears in CU’s `log_config` (which typically does not define MAC for CU), or if `None` is used as an invalid value/identifier (e.g., unquoted token), libconfig will error. Valid levels are strings like `"trace"|"debug"|"info"|"warn"|"error"` (exact set may vary), but `None` is invalid.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Key phases and signals:
- PHY/MAC init successful; TDD configured; SIB1 parameters printed; frequencies around 3.6192 GHz; band 78; 106 PRBs.
- F1AP start: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` → `F1AP ... retrying...`.
- DU waits: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

Interpretation:
- The DU is healthy enough to initialize but cannot complete F1 association because the CU never bound the SCTP server (due to its config abort). Thus, DU cannot activate radio and likely won’t run the rfsimulator server fully for UE to attach.

Cross-check with du_conf:
- IP/ports match the CU’s peer expectations (DU 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5). No PRACH or TDD configuration errors are reported; the block is purely in F1 connectivity.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Key lines:
- UE config matches DL 3619200000 Hz, µ=1, 106 PRBs.
- Runs as RFsim client connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043, repeated `connect() ... failed, errno(111)`.

Interpretation:
- UE can’t connect to the simulator server socket because DU has not fully activated radio / server-side endpoint. In OAI flows, DU only opens the RFsim server and becomes operational after F1 setup with CU. Since CU failed, DU never reaches the stage to accept UE RFsim connections, hence persistent connection refused.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU aborts on config parse error → F1-C server not listening.
  - DU retries to connect F1-C to CU and stalls waiting for F1 Setup Response.
  - UE attempts to connect to DU’s rfsim server and is refused because DU is not activated.

- Misconfigured parameter guidance:
  - `log_config.mac_log_level=None` is invalid. If present in CU config, it both introduces an unexpected key (MAC not applicable at CU) and an invalid value (`None`). Either can trigger libconfig syntax/type errors, matching the CU’s failure at line 85 in `log_config`.
  - Even if the erroneous key were in DU, DU logs here don’t show a parse abort; the problematic instance is clearly on CU, consistent with the CU logs.

- Root cause:
  - A malformed/invalid CU configuration in the `log_config` section, specifically `mac_log_level=None`, caused libconfig parse failure and CU initialization abort. This cascades into F1 connect failures at the DU and UE RFsim connection refusals.

Note: No evidence of PRACH/TDD/SIB errors. The issue is entirely pre-RAN activation due to CU config parse failure.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fixes:
- Remove `mac_log_level` from the CU `log_config` (since CU doesn’t use MAC logging), or set it only in the DU config.
- Ensure all log levels are valid strings: one of `"trace"`, `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"` (confirm exact set for your OAI build), not `None`.

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON excerpts):

Corrected CU `network_config.cu_conf.log_config` (no MAC key, valid strings):
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        "global_log_level": "info",
        "hw_log_level": "info",
        "phy_log_level": "info",
        "rlc_log_level": "info",
        "pdcp_log_level": "info",
        "rrc_log_level": "info",
        "ngap_log_level": "info",
        "f1ap_log_level": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Corrected DU `network_config.du_conf.log_config` (MAC retained but valid):
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "du_conf": {
      "log_config": {
        "global_log_level": "info",
        "hw_log_level": "info",
        "phy_log_level": "info",
        "mac_log_level": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after fix:
- Start CU first; verify no `[LIBCONFIG] ... syntax error` and that F1-C listens on 127.0.0.5:501.
- Start DU; expect F1 association success and `F1 Setup Response` followed by radio activation.
- Start UE; expect successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and SSB sync → RACH.

Further analysis if issues persist:
- If CU still fails, validate the exact line in the `.conf` around `log_config` for typos (missing quotes/commas) and verify acceptable enum values for your OAI version.
- If DU still doesn’t accept RFsim connections post F1 setup, ensure `rfsimulator.serveraddr` is configured for server mode (here it is `"server"`), and no port conflicts on 4043.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; exact ordering is inferred.
- The misconfigured parameter is provided as prior knowledge; we did not re-parse the original `.conf` content line-by-line.
- Accepted log level enumerations may vary slightly across OAI versions; confirm in your build if needed.
