## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The system is running OAI NR SA mode with RF simulator, indicated by CU/DU logs stating running in SA mode and UE logs showing rfsimulator client attempts to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected bring-up flow:
  1) DU initializes PHY/MAC and starts F1-C towards CU.
  2) CU accepts F1 setup; DU activates radio and starts RFsim server.
  3) UE connects to RFsim server, decodes SSB/SIB1, performs PRACH, RRC attach, NAS registration, and PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured_param: security.ciphering_algorithms[0]=nea9.
  - CU logs: [RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9" in section "security" confirm the parser rejects this value.
  - 3GPP 33.501 defines standardized NEA algorithms as NEA1, NEA2, NEA3 (and NEA0 for null). "nea9" is invalid and unsupported by OAI.

Parsed network_config essentials:
- cu_conf.security.ciphering_algorithms: ["nea9","nea2","nea1","nea0"]. The first entry is used as the highest-preference algorithm; being invalid, CU rejects the config.
- cu_conf.gNBs: F1 CU address 127.0.0.5, DU at 127.0.0.3, ports (CU:501, DU:500). NG interfaces set to 192.168.8.43 with AMF at 192.168.70.132 (not yet reached due to earlier failure).
- du_conf.MACRLCs/L1s/RUs show normal TDD n78 settings; servingCellConfigCommon includes prach_ConfigurationIndex 98 (valid for µ=1 long format) and band/numerology consistent with logs (DL 3.6192 GHz, N_RB 106, µ=1).
- du_conf.rfsimulator.serveraddr: "server", serverport: 4043. UE attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly and fails with errno(111) = connection refused, implying the DU’s RFsim server never started listening.

Conclusion of setup: The invalid CU security cipher algorithm prevents CU RRC/F1 configuration from completing, which blocks F1 setup; DU keeps retrying SCTP to CU and never activates radio, so RFsim server is not up, leading to UE connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode and build:
  - running in SA mode; develop hash b2c9a1d2b5.
  - Initialized RAN Context with L1/MAC/RU counts at zero (CU-only role), F1AP gNB_CU_id 3584.
- Critical error:
  - [RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9" in section "security".
  - Afterward we only see config file section reads; there is no evidence of F1C listener establishment or NGAP connection to AMF.
- Cross-reference to cu_conf.security confirms the first cipher entry is "nea9".
- Impact: CU’s RRC config assembly (including SIB/RRC profiles) fails; F1AP is not brought to a ready state for DU association.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- Initialization is normal: PHY/MAC init, TDD pattern, band 78, µ=1, N_RB=106, SIB1 parameters, antenna ports, etc.
- F1AP and GTPU threads start; DU attempts to connect F1-C to CU at 127.0.0.5 from 127.0.0.3.
- Repeated failures:
  - [SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused
  - [F1AP] Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3) ... retrying
- Key gate:
  - [GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio
- Because CU is not accepting F1 (blocked by invalid security config), the DU never transitions to active radio; hence the RFsim server is not started.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- Base PHY parameters align with DU (DL 3.6192 GHz, N_RB 106, µ=1, TDD).
- UE acts as RFsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- All attempts fail with errno(111) connection refused, consistent with no server listening (DU radio inactive due to F1 not set up).
- Therefore UE cannot even reach the stage of SSB/SIB1 decoding or PRACH; it is blocked by transport unavailability at the RFsim layer.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Sequence correlation:
  - CU rejects security config due to invalid cipher "nea9".
  - CU does not complete RRC/F1 setup.
  - DU cannot establish SCTP/F1-C to CU → remains in pre-activation state and does not start RFsim server.
  - UE, as RFsim client, cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 → stuck retrying.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): The invalid ciphering algorithm entry at cu_conf.security.ciphering_algorithms[0] = "nea9". OAI supports NEA0 (null), NEA1 (SNOW 3G), and NEA2 (AES-128). NEA3 may be optional depending on build; NEA9 is not a defined NEA algorithm in 3GPP.
- There is no evidence of PRACH or PHY issues; all failures are upstream (configuration → F1 → RFsim server availability).

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fix:
- Replace the invalid first preference cipher with a supported algorithm. Recommended order: ["nea2","nea1","nea0"]. Ensure integrity list remains supported ("nia2","nia0").
- After fixing CU security config, restart CU and DU to allow F1 setup to complete; DU should activate radio and bring up RFsim server; UE should then connect to RFsim server and proceed to SSB/SIB1/PRACH.

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        // Changed: remove invalid "nea9" and set supported preference order
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea2", "nea1", "nea0"],
        // Unchanged: integrity algorithms are valid
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"],

        "drb_integrity": "no"
      }
    },

      // No change required for DU; F1 setup will succeed once CU is fixed
      // Optional: keep rfsimulator.serveraddr/serverport as-is
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "server",
        "serverport": 4043
      }

    "ue_conf": {
      // No change needed; UE RF parameters match DU configuration

        "nssai_sst": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational follow-ups:
- After applying the fix, verify CU logs show successful F1AP listener and NGAP towards AMF.
- Confirm DU logs show F1 Setup Response received and radio activation; verify RFsim server is listening on 0.0.0.0:4043 (or localhost as configured).
- Confirm UE can connect to 127.0.0.1:4043; then observe SSB detection, SIB1 decoding, RA procedure, RRC Setup, NAS Registration.
- If NGAP/AMF connectivity then fails, check cu_conf NETWORK_INTERFACES and AMF IP reachability; however that is a separate stage.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps, so precise timing alignment is inferred from ordering.
- The DU/UE behavior is consistent with F1 not established; we assume OAI’s standard gating where DU radio activation depends on F1 Setup Response.
- The specification citations are not shown here; the conclusion relies on widely known 3GPP 33.501 NEA set and OAI’s support for NEA0/1/2. The explicit CU log error conclusively flags the configuration problem.
