## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The scenario is OAI 5G NR SA with `--rfsim` based on DU/UE logs and CU showing NGAP/AMF setup. Expected sequence: process config → start CU/DU → CU↔AMF NGSetup → F1AP CU↔DU SCTP → DU brings up PHY/MAC/RRC, encodes SIB1 → UE connects to rfsim server, performs PRACH/RA → RRC attach and PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**. In NR, the NR Cell ID (NCI) is 36 bits (TS 38.331/38.413 context). OAI computes a composite `cellID` based on `gNB_ID` and cell/sector indices. A too-large `gNB_ID` can overflow the 36-bit constraint causing assertion during SIB1 preparation.
- Network configuration (from logs inference):
  - gNB DL/UL frequency: 3.6192 GHz (band 48/78 noted inconsistently by DU log line, but absoluteFrequencySSB=641280 → 3619200000 Hz). TDD pattern present. CU NGAP to AMF: 192.168.8.43.
  - UE is rfsim client targeting localhost:4043 repeatedly failing (server not up).
- Initial mismatch: DU asserts in RRC while building SIB1 with message: "cellID must fit within 36 bits, but is 18446744073709551615" which equals `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`. This is consistent with `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` overflowing downstream computation.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU boots SA, initializes NGAP and GTP-U, registers gNB and macro gNB id, connects to AMF and receives NGSetupResponse successfully.
- Key lines:
  - "Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 192.168.8.43" then "Send NGSetupRequest" → "Received NGSetupResponse".
  - "F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5" then GTPU bind to 127.0.0.5:2152 and "Starting F1AP at CU".
- Notable: CU is ready and waiting for DU over F1AP SCTP on 127.0.0.5. No errors on CU side. gNB ID printed by CU: `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and NGAP shows macro gNB id 3584. This suggests expected gNB ID around 3584, contrasting with DU’s configured `0xFFFFFFFF`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly (mu=1, N_RB=106, TDD config), reads `ServingCellConfigCommon`, computes DL/UL frequencies, and starts building RRC/SIB1.
- Crash point:
  - Assertion in `get_SIB1_NR()` with message: "cellID must fit within 36 bits, but is 18446744073709551615" followed by process exit. This happens while composing SIB1 where `physCellId`/`cellIdentity` is encoded.
- Cause linkage: A 36-bit limit violation typically arises if `gNB_ID` bits overflow into the 36-bit `nCI` space. With `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all ones), and additional cell/sector bits added, OAI’s computation produced an invalid 64-bit all-ones value (likely due to sentinel/defaults or mask/shift mishandling when input is maxed), triggering the assert.
- Side-effect: DU aborts before starting the rfsim server, so no RF socket listens on 4043.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY for SA at 3.6192 GHz with TDD. It acts as rfsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, failing with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- Interpretation: The rfsim server lives inside the DU. Since DU crashed during SIB1 construction, the server never started, hence the UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU: healthy, NGSetup ok, awaiting F1AP from DU.
  - DU: crashes in RRC due to invalid `cellID` overflow during SIB1.
  - UE: cannot connect to rfsim server because DU never reached operational state.
- Misconfigured parameter: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**.
  - NR `nrCellID` is 36 bits. OAI constructs this using `gNB_ID` and cell/sector IDs. With `gNB_ID` at all ones, either:
    - The computed `cellID` exceeds 36 bits (overflow), or
    - Internal code paths treat `0xFFFFFFFF` as a sentinel and propagate all ones (observed 64-bit all ones) leading to assert.
  - CU shows gNB id 3584 as the expected value. DU should use a reasonable gNB_ID consistent with CU. Typical safe values are within valid NR ranges (e.g., under 2^22 or masked according to deployment). Ensuring the final `cellID` < 2^36 resolves the RRC assert.
- Root cause: DU configured `gNBs.gNB_ID` to `0xFFFFFFFF`, violating NR 36‑bit `cellIdentity` constraints during SIB1 creation in OAI, causing DU abort; CU remains idle; UE fails to connect to rfsim.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix the DU configuration by setting `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value consistent with CU and within constraints. Example: use decimal 3584 (as CU prints) or a small hexadecimal under the allowed mask, ensuring computed `cellID` < 2^36.
- After correction, verify DU proceeds past RRC SIB1 creation, rfsim server starts, UE connects, and RA/RRC attach proceed.
- If needed, confirm spec constraints:
  - NR Cell ID (NCI) is 36 bits (TS 38.331, TS 38.413 context); OAI assert enforces `< 1 << 36`.
- Suggested corrected snippets (embedded within your network_config JSON objects):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        // Changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to 3584 to fit 36-bit cellIdentity composition and match CU
        "gNB_ID": 3584,
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
        // Ensure other related identifiers (e.g., PLMN, TAC) remain unchanged
        "amf_ip": "192.168.8.43"
      },
      "rf": {
        "absoluteFrequencySSB": 641280, // 3619200000 Hz
        "dl_carrier_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_carrier_freq_hz": 3619200000,

        "tdd_ul_dl_configuration_common": {
          "pattern1": { "dl_slots": 8, "ul_slots": 3, "dl_symbols": 6, "ul_symbols": 4 }
        }
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
        "dl_carrier_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_carrier_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ssbSubcarrierSpacing": 30000,
        "N_RB_DL": 106
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Operational checks after fix:
  - DU logs should no longer show the `get_SIB1_NR()` assert; look for SIB1 broadcast success and RRC idle cell setup completed.
  - rfsim server should bind and UE should successfully connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
  - CU should report F1AP association established and proceed with UE RRC procedure when UE attempts access.
- Optional hardening:
  - Add validation in your config generation pipeline to reject `gNB_ID` values that would produce `cellID >= 2^36`.
  - Align CU/DU `gNB_ID` fields to avoid NGAP inconsistencies.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated around the assertion and don’t include the original config files; `gnb_conf` and `ue_conf` are inferred from log content. Exact allowed `gNB_ID` mask in your build may depend on OAI version; the observed assert conclusively points to 36-bit overflow.
- UE failure is consequential (no rfsim server) rather than causal; once DU runs, UE connection attempts should proceed.
- If further issues persist after fixing `gNB_ID`, inspect PRACH/SIB parameters and F1AP SCTP connectivity, but those are not implicated by current evidence.
