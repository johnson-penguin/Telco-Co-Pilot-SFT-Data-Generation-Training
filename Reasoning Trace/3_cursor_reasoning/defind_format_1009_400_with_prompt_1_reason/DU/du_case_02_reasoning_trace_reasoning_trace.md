## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The deployment runs OAI NR in SA mode with RF simulator:
  - CU logs: SA mode, NGAP setup with AMF succeeds, then F1AP starts.
  - DU logs: SA mode, exits early during configuration checks.
  - UE logs: RF simulator client repeatedly fails to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 (errno 111), implying the gNB DU RFsim server never came up.
- Expected call flow in SA+rfsim: CU initializes and connects to AMF (NGAP) → CU starts F1 (SCTP) → DU initializes PHY/MAC and RFsim server → CU↔DU F1 connection established → UE connects to RFsim server → PRACH/Random Access → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - This is an out-of-range value for OAI and conflicts with CU’s effective ID in logs (`gNB_CU_id` and NGAP macro gNB id both 3584 = 0xE00).
  - OAI’s config checker rejects invalid values; mismatched or out-of-range gNB IDs cause early exit of DU and can break F1/NGAP expectations.

Parsed network_config (key items inferred from logs and typical gnb/ue config fields):
- gnb_conf (relevant): `gNBs.gNB_ID` (should be a valid, consistent ID across CU/DU), `tracking_area_code` (must be in 1..65533), NGAP/AMF addressing, F1 CU/DU IPs for rfsim.
- ue_conf (relevant): RFsim server address/port (should reach DU), frequency/band/N_RB matching gNB, IMSI and PLMN.

Immediate mismatches surfaced by logs:
- DU reports `tracking_area_code: 0 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533` and exits via `config_execcheck()`.
- Misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is also invalid (too large) and inconsistent with CU’s 3584, likely contributing to the same config check failure bucket (`section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`).
- UE’s repeated connection failures to RFsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 are a downstream effect of the DU never starting its RFsim server due to configuration rejection.

Assumption: The JSON’s `misconfigured_param` reflects the primary intended fault to diagnose. We treat TAC=0 as an additional validation error surfaced in logs but center root cause on `gNBs.gNB_ID` invalidity and CU/DU ID inconsistency.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU initializes correctly:
  - SA mode, threads created for NGAP, RRC, GTP-U, CU-F1.
  - NGAP: `Send NGSetupRequest to AMF` → `Received NGSetupResponse from AMF` (AMF connected and accepted).
  - CU shows `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and `macro gNB id 3584`; internally it represents ID `3584 -> 0000e000` in logging.
- CU starts F1: `Starting F1AP at CU`, `F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5`.
- No subsequent F1 association success lines appear; CU seems to wait for DU side SCTP.
- Cross-reference with config intent:
  - CU’s effective gNB ID is 3584, not 0xFFFFFFFF. If DU tries to use 0xFFFFFFFF or fails config entirely, F1 association won’t proceed.

Conclusion: CU side is healthy and ready; it awaits DU. Its logs confirm a sane `gNB_ID` (3584), highlighting the inconsistency with the misconfigured DU config.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes, then config checker flags invalid values:
  - `tracking_area_code: 0 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533`.
  - `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`.
  - Exits via `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` before RFsim server spins up.
- No PHY bring-up beyond early prints; no RFsim `server` binding; no F1AP DU SCTP attempt logged.
- Link to `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`:
  - OAI expects a valid gNB ID; excessively large or out-of-spec values are rejected. Additionally, CU and DU must use the same ID for consistent NGAP/F1 identification.
  - With `0xFFFFFFFF`, the DU either fails validation outright or creates an identity mismatch with the CU’s `3584`.

Conclusion: DU exits due to configuration validation failures (at least TAC=0; and the misconfigured `gNB_ID`), which prevents RFsim server creation and F1 association, blocking the rest of the system.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE PHY initializes (N_RB_DL 106 at ~3.6192 GHz; TDD; typical FR1 SA test setup), then:
  - Acts as RFsim client and repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
  - All attempts fail with `errno(111)` (connection refused), consistent with no listening server on DU side.

Conclusion: UE failures are secondary. The root cause is that the DU never started its RFsim server because it exited during config checks.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU succeeds NGAP with AMF and starts F1 → DU exits during config checks → UE cannot connect to RFsim server.
- Misconfigured parameter guidance: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid and inconsistent with CU’s `3584`.
  - NGAP/F1 assume a coherent gNB identity; ID mismatch or invalidity at DU disrupts expected message formation/acceptance and can be hard-failed by config validators.
  - DU logs show config checker termination, supporting that invalid identity parameters (and TAC=0) caused a hard stop.
- Root cause: Invalid and inconsistent `gNBs.gNB_ID` in DU configuration (set to `0xFFFFFFFF`), compounded by `tracking_area_code=0`. This prevents DU startup, cascades to F1 inactivity and UE connect failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Primary fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value and keep it consistent across CU and DU. Use the CU’s observed value `3584` (0xE00) for both.
- Correct `tracking_area_code` to a valid range value (e.g., `1`).

Validation steps after change:
- Start DU first; confirm RFsim server listening on 4043.
- Start CU; verify F1AP association success.
- Start UE; confirm connection to RFsim server, PRACH and RRC attach progress.

Corrected network_config snippets (inline comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "gNB_ID": 3584, // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to match CU logs and valid range
          "tracking_area_code": 1, // changed from 0 to a valid value (1..65533)
          "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU", // optional: align with CU name in logs
          "amf_ip": "192.168.8.43", // as seen in CU GTPU/NGAP config lines
          "f1_cu_ip": "127.0.0.5", // CU’s F1 bind/target per logs
          "f1_du_ip": "127.0.0.1", // DU side loopback for rfsim (example)
          "rfsim_listen_port": 4043 // DU RFsim server port expected by UE
        }
      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf_simulator": {
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043 // must match DU rfsim server
      },
      "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
      "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
      "n_rb_dl": 106,
      "duplex_mode": "TDD"
    }
  }
}
```

Further checks if issues persist:
- Ensure CU and DU both use the same PLMN and `nr_cellid` parameters; mismatch can break system information decoding and attach.
- Confirm F1 SCTP connectivity (iptables/firewall off for loopback; correct IPs).
- Verify no additional invalid config values are present (e.g., negative numerologies, PRACH config mismatches) by inspecting OAI’s `config_execcheck` output in verbose mode.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are partial and do not include explicit DU gNB_ID prints; the diagnosis relies on the provided `misconfigured_param` and CU’s logged ID (3584) for consistency inference.
- TAC=0 appears as an additional error; we treat it as co-occurring but not the intentional focus. Both must be fixed.
- No direct 3GPP citation is included here; in general, OAI expects a sane gNB ID and consistent identity across CU/DU. Very large values like `0xFFFFFFFF` are rejected by config validators and/or create inter-component mismatches.
