## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
Based on the logs, this is an OAI 5G NR Standalone (SA) deployment using `rfsim` with split CU/DU and a simulated UE:
- CU indicates SA mode and proceeds with NGAP setup to AMF.
- DU starts PHY/MAC init but exits during configuration checks.
- UE runs as an `rfsimulator` client continuously failing to connect to the server at `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Expected flow in SA+rfsim:
1) CU initializes, connects to AMF via NGAP, and waits for F1 from DU.
2) DU initializes PHY/MAC, starts rfsim server, and establishes F1AP with CU.
3) UE connects to the rfsim server, searches SSB, performs PRACH/RA, RRC attach, and PDU session.

Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- In OAI, valid `gNB_ID` is a bounded bit field (typically up to 22 bits for NGAP gNB-ID in many deployments). Excessively large values are either rejected at config parse or masked, potentially causing inconsistent identity across components.
- CU log shows a macro gNB id of `3584` and prints `3584 -> 0000e000`, suggesting OAI masked/truncated the configured ID to a valid range. If DU applies a different mask or rejects outright, CU/DU identity may diverge.

Parsed network_config: Not explicitly provided in the JSON (missing `network_config.gnb_conf` and `ue_conf`). We infer from logs:
- CU: `NGSetupRequest` sent, AMF IP `192.168.8.43`, gNB macro ID displayed as `3584`.
- DU: exits due to configuration checks; separate log also flags `mcc: 1000 invalid`. This indicates additional config issues beyond `gNB_ID`.
- UE: tries to connect to rfsim server `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails, implying DU never brought up the rfsim server socket due to its early exit.

Initial mismatch snapshot:
- Misconfigured `gNB_ID` is out-of-range (`0xFFFFFFFF`). CU normalizes to `3584` but DU likely fails earlier or could normalize differently → risk of CU/DU identity mismatch and F1AP failure.
- DU additionally shows `mcc` invalid (`1000`), which is a separate fatal config error halting DU before any radio plane or F1AP comes up.

Key parameters to watch (from typical `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf`): `gNB_ID`, PLMN `mcc/mnc`, `rfsimulator` addresses/ports, TDD config, SSB ARFCN, bandwidth, and PRACH parameters. The dominating problem here is identity/PLMN validity and DU not launching the rfsim server.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
CU initialization proceeds normally:
- SA mode confirmed; NGAP, GTP-U threads created; AMF IP parsed (`192.168.8.43`).
- `NGAP: Send NGSetupRequest` and `Received NGSetupResponse` → CU is registered with AMF successfully.
- CU prints `Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584` and also `3584 -> 0000e000`. This shows the effective NGAP gNB-ID is `3584` (likely masked from the configured value).
- F1AP at CU starts and opens SCTP to `127.0.0.5` awaiting DU.

No CU anomalies except that it waits for DU (no F1 SETUP COMPLETE observed). The CU’s effective gNB-ID is consistent internally but may not match the DU if the DU interpreted `gNB_ID` differently or exited early.

Cross-reference to config:
- CU’s successful AMF registration confirms NGAP-side parameters (AMF IP/port) are valid. The identity shown (3584) suggests masking of the misconfigured `gNB_ID`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
DU progresses through PHY/MAC initialization and TDD configuration, then aborts:
- PHY parameters (band n78/n48 style center frequency ~3.6192 GHz, µ=1, 106 PRBs) are consistent with UE logs.
- Critical errors:
  - `config_check_intrange: mcc: 1000 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999`.
  - `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`.
  - Immediate `Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.

Interpretation:
- The DU fails its configuration checks due to an invalid `mcc`. This alone prevents the DU from starting the rfsim server and from attempting F1AP association with the CU.
- With the misconfigured `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, the DU might also have failed or (if past PLMN fix) could normalize/mask differently. Either scenario can trigger F1AP identity mismatch with the CU.

Link to `gNB_ID`:
- Even though the log flags `mcc` explicitly, the `gNB_ID` value is also invalid per the provided misconfigured parameter. OAI typically enforces a bounded range and may mask values. If CU masked to `3584` while DU masked/parsed differently or rejected, CU/DU identities would differ, causing F1 SETUP failure once DU reaches that stage. In this run, DU exits before that due to PLMN.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
UE initializes PHY and repeatedly attempts to connect to the rfsimulator server:
- Multiple `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` followed by `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` indicates connection refused.
- This means the rfsim server is not listening on the DU side (typical when DU crashes before starting the simulator device server).

Config linkage:
- UE’s frequency plan and numerology match the DU’s displayed parameters.
- The rfsim connection failures are a downstream symptom of the DU exiting during config checks.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU registers to AMF and starts F1AP listener.
- DU aborts during configuration checks (invalid PLMN `mcc`, and misconfigured `gNB_ID` according to provided parameter), so it never brings up the rfsim server nor F1.
- UE cannot connect to the rfsim server → repeated `errno(111)`.

Root cause synthesis guided by `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`:
- `gNB_ID` out of allowed range causes identity inconsistency and/or config rejection. CU evidence shows masking to `3584`, indicating that OAI clamps invalid IDs. If DU either rejects the value or clamps differently, CU/DU will disagree about the gNB identity, which is critical for NG/F1 procedures. This would lead to F1 SETUP failure even if the DU passed the PLMN check.
- In this specific log set, the DU exits earlier due to an invalid `mcc=1000`. That is an additional misconfiguration that must also be corrected. After fixing PLMN, the `gNB_ID` must be set to a valid bounded value that matches the CU’s effective ID or is consistently applied on both CU and DU configs.

External knowledge (3GPP/OAI):
- NGAP gNB-ID is a bounded bit field (commonly up to 22 bits in practice for the macro gNB-ID when forming the 36-bit NR cell identity). Values like `0xFFFFFFFF` exceed such bounds and are invalid. OAI config parsers often enforce ranges and may mask, but mismatches across CU/DU will break F1.

Conclusion:
- Primary: Misconfigured `gNB_ID` to an out-of-range value leads to identity masking/normalization on the CU and likely rejection or divergent normalization on the DU, risking CU/DU identity mismatch and F1 failure.
- Immediate blocker observed: DU exits due to invalid PLMN `mcc`. This prevents the rfsim server from starting, causing UE connection failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration fixes (both CU and DU must be consistent):
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within the allowed range, and use the same value on CU and DU. Given the CU showed `3584`, set both to `3584` (decimal) or `0xE00` (hex). This matches the CU’s effective masked value and avoids identity mismatch.
- Correct PLMN entries: set `mcc` to a valid 3-digit value (e.g., `001`), and ensure `mnc` is valid (e.g., `01` or `001`) on both CU and DU.
- Ensure the DU’s rfsimulator server is configured to listen on `127.0.0.1:4043` (default), and UE points to the same address/port.

Operational checks after applying the fixes:
- Start DU first and verify it announces the rfsim server listening. Confirm no `config_execcheck` failures.
- Start CU and verify F1 SETUP is completed (F1AP SETUP messages exchanged) and NG remains registered.
- Start UE and confirm it connects to rfsim server, detects SSB, performs RA, receives SIB1, and proceeds with RRC attach.

Corrected configuration snippets (representative JSON reflecting `network_config` structure):

      "plmn": { "mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2 }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes on the snippet:
- `gNB_ID`: set to `3584` to align with CU’s effective ID from logs.
- PLMN: `mcc=1`, `mnc=1` (i.e., "001/01") to avoid the `1000` out-of-range error; use your intended PLMN as long as it’s valid.
- rfsim: ensure addresses/ports match between DU (server) and UE (client).
- SSB/TDD values mirror the logs to preserve radio alignment.

Further analysis if issues persist:
- Enable higher log levels on DU (`--log_config.global_log_options level,nr_*:debug`) and capture F1AP traces on CU to verify identity agreement.
- Dump the effective CU/DU IDs at runtime (OAI logs print them) and confirm equality.
- If identity mismatch persists, search source for `gNB_ID` masking/validation to confirm the allowed bit length and ensure both configs respect it.

## 7. Limitations
- The provided JSON lacks the explicit `network_config.gnb_conf`/`ue_conf` content; fixes above are inferred from logs and typical defaults.
- Logs are truncated and omit timestamps; we infer order by message semantics.
- Multiple misconfigurations are present (invalid `mcc` and out-of-range `gNB_ID`). We highlighted `gNB_ID` as the specified root cause and noted PLMN as an additional blocker that must be fixed first to allow DU to start.
