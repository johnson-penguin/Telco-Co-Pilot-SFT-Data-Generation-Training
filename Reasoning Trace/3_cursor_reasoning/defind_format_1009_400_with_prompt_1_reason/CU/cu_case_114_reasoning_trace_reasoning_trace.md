## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

The logs show OAI NR SA mode with RF simulator:
- CU/DU started with `--rfsim --sa` and DU attempting F1-C over SCTP to the CU (`127.0.0.3 -> 127.0.0.5`).
- UE is rfsim client repeatedly trying to reach `127.0.0.1:4043` and getting `errno(111)` (connection refused), meaning the rfsim server is not up from the gNB side.

Expected SA bring-up flow:
1) CU parses config, initializes F1-C server, NGAP/GTP, then waits for DU.
2) DU initializes PHY/MAC, connects F1-C to CU, then activates radio and starts the rfsim server.
3) UE connects to rfsim server, performs cell search/SSB sync, PRACH, RRC connection, and PDU session.

Given misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- In NR, the gNB-ID is at most 32 bits with a 22-bit gNB-ID part when combined with NR Cell ID; OAI validates ranges and commonly rejects out-of-range or reserved values. `0xFFFFFFFF` is max 32-bit and not a valid 22-bit gNB-ID. Such a value can cause config checks to fail early.
- CU logs explicitly show config validation failures (also for `mcc: 1000 invalid value`). CU exits before standing up F1-C.

Network config parsing:
- The provided JSON does not include a `network_config` object. Therefore, extracted `gnb_conf`/`ue_conf` parameters are inferred from logs:
  - From DU/RRC logs: `DLBand 78`, `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 -> 3619200000 Hz`, `N_RB 106`, TDD config present.
  - DU attempts F1-C to CU `127.0.0.5`; GTP local `127.0.0.3`.
  - UE tuned to `3619200000 Hz`, numerology `mu=1`, TDD.
  - CU exits during config checks; hence F1-C and rfsim server are never ready.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Key lines:
- `[GNB_APP] F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU` show early init.
- `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: mcc: 1000 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999` indicates at least one PLMN issue.
- `[ENB_APP] [CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` confirms validation error.
- `config_userapi.c:102 config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` shows the CU aborts during configuration verification.

Implication:
- With the misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (and also an invalid MCC in the same config), CU never opens SCTP F1-C endpoint nor NGAP.
- This directly causes DU F1-C connection refusals and prevents rfsim server startup.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Key lines:
- PHY/MAC init succeeds, TDD configured, frequencies derived: `DL 3619200000 Hz`, `N_RB 106`, SSB numerology `mu=1`.
- F1AP attempts: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` followed by repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and F1AP retries.
- DU waits: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

Implication:
- DU is healthy but cannot proceed without CU’s F1-C server. No radio activation occurs, and the rfsim server is not created.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Key lines:
- UE config aligns with DU: `DL 3619200000 Hz`, `N_RB_DL 106`, TDD with `mu=1`.
- UE acts as rfsim client: repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`; each attempt fails with `errno(111)`.

Implication:
- The rfsim server side (gNB) is not listening because CU aborted and DU never activated radio. Hence UE cannot connect.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU aborts during config_execcheck due to invalid parameters. The known misconfiguration `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is sufficient to fail config sanity checks; CU log also shows `mcc: 1000` invalid.
- DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU because CU never started F1-C.
- UE cannot connect to rfsim server because DU never activates radio and rfsim server is not instantiated without successful F1 Setup.

Root cause:
- Misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (out of valid range) in CU configuration causes CU to exit during configuration checks. Secondary issue: PLMN MCC set to 1000 is also invalid.

External reference (standards/implementation knowledge):
- In 5G NR, the gNB identifier used in NG-RAN is typically up to 32 bits, but practical deployments (and OAI’s config validators) constrain how gNB-ID composes into the 36-bit NR Cell ID with the 14-bit NR PCI, and reject obviously invalid values. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` as a blanket ID fails those checks. MCC must be a 3-digit decimal (000–999); value 1000 is invalid.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Required configuration fixes in CU `gnb.conf`:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value. Choose a small 22-bit-safe value, e.g., `0x0000001`.
- Correct PLMN to valid MCC/MNC (e.g., `mcc=001`, `mnc=01`).
- Keep DU and UE RF parameters consistent (they already match at 3619.2 MHz, N_RB=106, TDD mu=1).

After applying, expected behavior:
- CU passes config checks, starts F1-C and rfsim server.
- DU connects over SCTP, completes F1 Setup, activates radio.
- UE connects to rfsim server, proceeds with SSB sync → PRACH → RRC → PDU session.

Suggested corrected snippets (as JSON within a `network_config` structure). Comments clarify changes.

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x0000001", // CHANGED: from 0xFFFFFFFF to a valid small ID
        "plmn_list": [
          { "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" } // CHANGED: MCC 001 is valid, MNC 01
        ],
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
        "F1AP": { "CU_IP": "127.0.0.5" },

      },

    },
    "ue_conf": {

        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1:4043",

      },
      "plmn": { "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" }
    }
  }
}
```

Further checks:
- Verify CU log no longer shows `config_execcheck` errors.
- Confirm DU F1 Setup completes and radio activation happens.
- Ensure UE connects to rfsim server (no more `errno(111)`), then observe PRACH and RRC connection.


## 7. Limitations

- The provided JSON lacks a `network_config` object; gNB/UE parameter values were inferred from logs and typical OAI defaults.
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; exact ordering is inferred but consistent with observed failures.
- No external spec lookup was required; conclusions rely on OAI validation behavior and NR ID constraints; MCC validity bound is per PLMN formatting rules.
