## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The setup runs OAI NR in SA mode with `--rfsim` on a single host. CU and DU are split (F1-C over SCTP), and UE uses the RF simulator client to connect to the gNB RF simulator server.
- Expected bring-up sequence: process init → CU NGAP to AMF → F1-C association (DU→CU) → DU activates radio → UE connects to RF simulator server → RACH/PRACH → RRC setup → (optionally) PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In 5G, the gNB ID is constrained (max 22 bits, per 3GPP TS 38.413/38.401). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits all ones) exceeds valid range and will be masked/truncated by implementations, potentially causing ID mismatch and undefined behavior.

Parsed parameters from logs/network_config (inferred since only logs are given explicitly):
- gNB side (from logs):
  - CU: NGAP shows macro gNB id derived as `3584` (0x0E00), see `[NGAP] 3584 -> 0000e000`.
  - DU: `gNB_DU_id 3584`, DU F1-C connects to CU at `127.0.0.5`, DU GTP-U binds `127.0.0.3`.
  - TDD config, DL/UL at 3619.2 MHz, N_RB 106 (BW 40–50/100 MHz depending on SCS), numerology µ=1; consistent across DU and UE logs.

Initial mismatch signals:
- The configured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid and would be truncated. CU logs indeed show a truncated macro gNB id (`3584`). Such overflow can corrupt identity encoding and inter-task registrations.
- CU shows GTP-U initialization with an empty local IP: `Initializing UDP for local address  with port 2152` followed by `getaddrinfo error`. This indicates config parsing state is inconsistent, likely a side-effect of malformed/overflowing values earlier in config processing.

Assumption tying to misconfigured_param:
- The invalid `gNB_ID` overflows OAI’s ID handling, leading to truncated internal IDs and can also destabilize the configuration parsing or subsequent module initializations (e.g., net params), culminating in CU GTP-U not binding and F1-C not starting.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Key sequences:
- SA mode confirmed; NGAP task started; CU-UP accepted; NGSetupRequest sent and NGSetupResponse received → NGAP to AMF is up.
- CU F1AP starting; but before F1-C listener is effectively ready, CU attempts to initialize GTP-U and fails:
  - `GTPU Initializing UDP for local address  with port 2152`
  - `getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known`
  - Assertion failures in `sctp_create_new_listener()` and later `F1AP_CU_task()` due to `getCxt(instance)->gtpInst > 0` failing → CU exits.

Observations:
- NGAP success shows basic RAN identity encoding didn’t hard-fail ASN.1, but `[NGAP] 3584 -> 0000e000` reveals truncation/masking of the gNB ID.
- The empty GTP bind address strongly suggests that CU config parsing yielded an empty/invalid `GTP_bind_addr` (or equivalent `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_GTPU`) at the point GTP-U was created. In OAI, early config errors (including invalid values) can propagate to later sections being unset.
- CU crashes before establishing F1-C SCTP listener; therefore DU cannot connect (as seen next).

Relevance to `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`:
- An out-of-range `gNB_ID` is not just a semantic mismatch; OAI internally maps/derives macro IDs and node identifiers. Overflow can produce unexpected behavior, including mis-encoded IDs and brittle config state, which aligns with the CU collapsing before F1-C comes up.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Key sequences:
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 correctly, configures TDD patterns, frequencies, and frame parameters. F1AP at DU starts. DU intends to connect F1-C to CU at `127.0.0.5`; GTP-U binds to `127.0.0.3:2152` successfully.
- Repeated SCTP connect failures to CU: `Connect failed: Connection refused` with retries. DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.

Interpretation:
- DU is healthy at L1/MAC and net stack. The sole blocker is the CU F1-C server not listening (connection refused), consistent with CU crash following GTP-U init failure.
- DU’s `gNB_DU_id 3584` matches the truncated macro id seen on CU (3584). While this coincidental match avoids an immediate DU/CU ID mismatch, it results from truncation, not from a valid design, and remains fragile.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Key sequences:
- UE PHY initializes with parameters matching DU (DL 3619.2 MHz, µ=1, N_RB 106). UE runs RF simulator client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` but gets `errno(111)`.

Interpretation:
- In OAI rfsim mode, the gNB process hosts the RF simulator server. Since CU/DU are not operational as a whole (CU crashed and DU is waiting), the RF simulator server side is not up; thus UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU reaches NGAP success but fails GTP-U init (empty bind address) → assertions → CU exits.
- DU repeatedly attempts F1-C to CU → connection refused → DU never activates radio.
- UE tries connecting to rfsim server → connection refused → no PRACH/RRC progress.

Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param):
- The configured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is outside the allowed range (max 22 bits). OAI truncates/masks it to `0x0E00` (decimal 3584), as shown in CU logs. Such invalid configuration can:
  - Corrupt internal identity derivations used in NGAP/F1AP (node IDs, gNB-DU/CU IDs), risking mismatches and brittle behavior.
  - Disrupt config parsing or validation order, leaving subsequent sections (e.g., NET/GTP config) unset → observed empty GTP bind address and assertion cascade.
- Therefore, the misconfigured gNB ID is the initiating fault leading to CU crash; the DU/UE failures are downstream effects.

Standards background (for validation):
- 3GPP limits the gNB-ID to up to 32 bits in some contexts, but NGAP commonly uses a 22-bit gNB-ID field (TS 38.413); OAI historically expects gNB ID within a constrained range and treats the macro ID with specific bit lengths. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` violates these assumptions, leading to truncation and undefined behavior.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Configuration fixes:
- Set a valid `gNBs.gNB_ID` within the expected range and keep it consistent between CU and DU. For example, use decimal `3584` (0x0E00) explicitly, or another valid 22-bit value, and ensure DU/CU alignment.
- Ensure NET/GTP parameters are explicitly set (avoid empty bind addresses). For rfsim single-host setups:
  - CU F1-C bind: `127.0.0.5`
  - DU F1-C bind: `127.0.0.3`, CU target: `127.0.0.5`
  - CU GTP-U bind: `127.0.0.5`, DU GTP-U bind: `127.0.0.3`
  - NGAP/SCTP to AMF: ensure valid AMF IP (seen as `192.168.8.43` in logs)

}
```

Operational checks after applying the fix:
- Verify CU logs show a non-empty GTP-U bind address and successful GTP-U instance creation.
- Confirm F1AP at CU listens; DU connects and receives F1 Setup Response; DU activates radio.
- Ensure UE connects to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043; observe PRACH attempts and RRC connection setup.

Further analysis (if issues persist):
- If GTP-U still fails, explicitly set and validate `GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU` in CU config and verify DNS resolution is not invoked (use literal IPs).
- Cross-check NGAP `gNB-ID` encoding in CU traces and F1AP DU/CU IDs for strict equality.
- Validate AMF reachability and SCTP ports (NGAP) if NGSetup loops occur.

## 7. Limitations

- The provided data omits the full `network_config` JSON; mappings are inferred from logs. The CU shows both a truncated gNB ID and an empty GTP bind address; while the former is the guided misconfiguration, the latter is the immediate cause of CU crash. The analysis posits the invalid `gNB_ID` as the initiating error that destabilized config state.
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps, so precise ordering is inferred from message flow.
- Specification citations are high-level; for exact bit lengths see 3GPP TS 38.413/38.401 and OAI ID handling in NGAP/F1AP layers.
