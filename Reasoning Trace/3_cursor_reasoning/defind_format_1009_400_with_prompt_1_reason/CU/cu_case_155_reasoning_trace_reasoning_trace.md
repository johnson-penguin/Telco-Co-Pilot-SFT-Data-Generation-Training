## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- Deployment: OAI NR SA over rfsim. CU/DU logs show "--rfsim --sa"; UE repeatedly attempts TCP to `127.0.0.1:4043` (typical rfsim server on gNB side).
- Expected flow: CU parses config ??starts F1-C/SCTP listener and rfsim server ??DU connects F1-C ??cell configured (TDD/SIB1) ??UE connects to rfsim ??SSB detect ??PRACH ??RRC setup ??PDU session. The flow aborts at CU config stage here.
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - gNB ID signaled in NGAP/F1AP is bounded (commonly 22-bit NG-RAN gNB ID; max `0x3FFFFF`). `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit) violates the allowed range, causing OAI config validation (`config_execcheck`) to abort.
- Network configuration (from logs):
  - CU: reads `GNBSParams`, then config checker flags PLMN issue (`mnc_length` invalid) and exits via `config_execcheck`.
  - DU: coherent RF (n78, 3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs), TDD pattern index 6; tries F1-C to CU at `127.0.0.5` from `127.0.0.3` and gets `Connection refused` loops.
  - UE: RF matches DU; rfsim client cannot connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (connection refused).
- Early mismatches:
  - CU exits during config validation (before starting F1AP/SCTP or rfsim server).
  - DU/UE connection refusals are downstream symptoms of CU not running.
  - The supplied `gNB_ID` misconfiguration alone is sufficient to cause this behavior; PLMN errors compound it.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode/version: SA mode, branch develop, build printed.
- Early init: RAN context initialized, CU id print (`gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`), CU name printed.
- Validation failure: `config_check_intval: mnc_length: 9999999 invalid value` ??`config_execcheck()` exits; occurs right after reading GNBSParams/SCTPParams sections.
Interpretation:
- CU never reaches network bring-up (no SCTP/F1AP listener; no rfsim server). Even if PLMN were valid, `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` independently violates OAI? range checks and would trigger the same fatal exit path.
Cross-reference:
- OAI commonly uses small integer `gNB_ID` values like 3584 (`0xE00`). Valid upper bound for NG-RAN gNB ID is typically `0x3FFFFF`. The configured `0xFFFFFFFF` is out-of-range.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- PHY/MAC bring-up is nominal: n78, DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, N_RB 106, TDD pattern index 6; SIB1 params parsed; multiple TDD slots configured; RU init OK.
- F1AP: DU initiates F1-C towards CU `127.0.0.5`; repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused`; DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
Interpretation:
- DU is healthy; it is blocked because the CU never started F1-C listener due to config abort. No PRACH/PHY assertions appear, so the problem is not PHY-level.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE RF matches DU (3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, TDD). Threads created; PRS not configured (benign).
- rfsim: UE acts as client, repeatedly connecting to `127.0.0.1:4043`; every attempt fails with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
Interpretation:
- The gNB rfsim server is absent because the CU process exited during validation; therefore, UE cannot connect. RF parameters themselves are consistent.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU exits during configuration validation ??no F1-C/SCTP listener and no rfsim server.
- DU? F1-C attempts to CU get refused repeatedly ??stuck waiting for F1 Setup.
- UE? TCP attempts to rfsim server get refused repeatedly ??no access procedures start.
Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param):
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds valid bounds (commonly ??`0x3FFFFF`). OAI? `config_execcheck()` aborts the CU. Additional PLMN errors (invalid `mnc_length`) confirm broader config corruption but are not required to explain this failure.
Effect chain:
- Out-of-range gNB_ID ??CU aborts ??DU F1-C refused ??UE rfsim refused ??no RRC or user-plane procedures.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value. Reuse a known-good value from logs, e.g., 3584 (`0xE00`), and ensure it is ??`0x3FFFFF`.
Secondary fixes/validations:
- Correct PLMN: `mcc` and `mnc` within [0,999]; `mnc_length` ??{2,3}. The log shows invalid `mnc_length`.
- Verify F1-C addressing (DU `127.0.0.3` ??CU `127.0.0.5`) and allow SCTP in firewall.
- Ensure UE `rfsimulator_serveraddr`/port targets the CU host (often `127.0.0.1:4043`).

Corrected configuration snippets (embedded in expected `network_config` shape):
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": 3584,
        "note": "Changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to 3584 (0xE00); must be ??0x3FFFFF"
      },
      "plmn_list": {
        "mcc": 1,
        "mnc": 1,
        "mnc_length": 2,
        "note": "Fix invalid PLMN fields; use valid ranges and consistent length"
      }
      /* retain TDD, band, TAC, AMF/F1 IPs as per baseline */
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "n_rb_dl": 106
      },
      "rfsim": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043
      }
      /* ensure IMSI PLMN matches gNB (001/01 here) */
    }
  }
}
```
Operational checks after change:
- Start CU: confirm no `config_execcheck()` abort; verify F1-C listener and rfsim port 4043 are open (logs or `ss`/Windows equivalent).
- Start DU: expect F1 Setup success and radio activation.
- Start UE: expect TCP connect to rfsim server, SSB detect, PRACH, RRC setup.
If problems persist:
- Increase CONFIG/F1AP/SCTP/RRC log levels; confirm CU bind IP matches DU target; validate PLMN/TAI and AMF reachability (if NGAP used).


## 7. Limitations
- Exact `gnb_conf`/`ue_conf` JSON not fully provided; the fix shows representative values consistent with logs. The PLMN invalidity indicates additional fields may need correction.
- gNB ID bit-length can depend on profile; `??0x3FFFFF` is a conservative bound used widely in OAI NG-RAN deployments. Check your OAI branch? validator for precise constraints.
- Diagnosis relies on the supplied misconfigured parameter and matches cross-component symptoms (CU abort ??DU/UE refusals).
