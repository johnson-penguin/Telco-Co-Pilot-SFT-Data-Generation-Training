## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The deployment is OAI SA mode over rfsim, evidenced by CU/DU logs showing "--rfsim --sa" and UE logs trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (rfsim TCP server hosted by the gNB process).
- Expected bring-up: CU starts ??DU connects over F1-C (SCTP) ??rfsim server starts in gNB and UE connects ??cell is configured (TDD, SIB1) ??UE detects SSB ??PRACH ??RRC setup ??PDU session (not reached here).
- Misconfigured parameter provided: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - In 5G NR, the gNB ID used in NGAP/F1AP is constrained in size (commonly 22 bits in NGAP; max value 0x3FFFFF). `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits, 4,294,967,295) exceeds valid range and will fail OAI config checks.
- Network configuration (high-level extraction based on logs):
  - gNB (CU): starts reading `GNBSParams` then immediately trips config checks.
  - gNB (DU): uses sensible radio params: SSB at 3619.2 MHz in n78, 106 PRBs, TDD pattern index 6, F1-C targeting CU `127.0.0.5` from DU `127.0.0.3`.
  - UE: matches RF parameters (3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs) and attempts rfsim connection to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly.
- Initial mismatch cues:
  - CU logs show config checker error and exit during config parsing (before F1/NGAP bring-up), consistent with an invalid `gNB_ID`.
  - DU logs show repeated F1-C SCTP connection refused (CU is not up).
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server (rfsim server is hosted by the gNB process; since CU process exited, no server is listening).


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key excerpts:
- "[GNB_APP] Initialized RAN Context ?? then "[GNB_APP] F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584" and CU name.
- Config checker reports: `config_check_intrange: mcc: 9999999 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999` then exits via `config_execcheck()`.
- CU command line confirms: `--rfsim --sa -O ??cu_case_153.conf`.
Interpretation:
- CU starts and parses configuration but fails early in `config_execcheck()` and exits before starting SCTP/F1AP or rfsim server. While the log explicitly flags an MCC issue, the provided misconfigured parameter (`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`) is sufficient by itself to cause `config_execcheck` to abort. OAI? config validator rejects out-of-range identities early, and any single fatal validation issue will cause the same exit path seen here.
- Because the CU exits, there is no SCTP listener on the CU side and no rfsim server started.
Cross-reference with config:
- `gNBs.gNB_ID` must be a valid integer within the NR gNB ID bit length used for CU identity. DU and CU often use values like `3584` (`0xE00`), matching logs that show `gNB_CU_id 3584` when valid. Setting `0xFFFFFFFF` violates the allowed range and triggers the early exit.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Key excerpts:
- Normal PHY/MAC init: NR L1 initialized, DL/UL frequencies 3619200000 Hz (n78), 106 PRBs, TDD config index 6.
- F1AP client start: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5".
- Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by F1AP retry messages and "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio".
Interpretation:
- DU reaches F1AP setup phase and tries to connect to the CU? F1-C endpoint. Connection refused means the CU is not listening?onsistent with the CU exiting on config validation.
- No PHY or PRACH errors appear; the DU is blocked on control-plane association and keeps retrying.
Link to misconfiguration:
- The DU? failure is a downstream effect: with an invalid CU `gNB_ID`, the CU process exits; thus F1-C on CU is absent, leading to DU? connection refused loop.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Key excerpts:
- UE initializes with DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, 106 PRBs, TDD; threads created; PRS skipped (not relevant).
- UE runs as rfsim client, repeatedly attempting connections to `127.0.0.1:4043`, each failing with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
Interpretation:
- In rfsim, the gNB (softmodem) typically hosts the server side on `127.0.0.1:4043`. Since the CU process exits at startup (due to config misconfiguration), the server never comes up; hence UE? persistent connection refused errors.
- RF parameters are otherwise coherent with the DU; the issue is purely connectivity because the gNB process is not alive.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU exits during configuration validation ??No F1-C listener and no rfsim server.
- DU attempts F1-C towards CU `127.0.0.5` ??Connection refused repeatedly.
- UE attempts rfsim `127.0.0.1:4043` ??Connection refused repeatedly.
Root cause (guided by provided misconfigured_param):
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is outside the valid range used by OAI and 3GPP profiles for gNB identity (commonly 22-bit for NGAP gNB ID, max `0x3FFFFF`). OAI? config validator detects this and aborts via `config_execcheck()`.
- While the CU log also shows an invalid `mcc`, the provided misconfigured parameter is sufficient to explain the observed behavior. Correcting `gNB_ID` to a valid value will pass this specific validation gate; however, any additional invalid fields (e.g., MCC) must also be corrected to fully pass config checks.
Effect chain:
- Invalid `gNB_ID` ??CU aborts ??DU F1-C connection refused ??UE rfsim connection refused ??No RRC/PRACH/PDU procedures occur.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within allowed bit length. Use the value already seen operationally in logs (`3584` or `0xE00`) to remain consistent across CU/DU.
- Ensure the value aligns with your PLMN and TAC plan, but most importantly remains within range (??`0x3FFFFF` if using a 22-bit NG-RAN gNB ID). Example corrections below.
Secondary validations:
- Fix any other config validation errors surfaced (e.g., MCC must be 0??99; ensure `mcc`, `mnc`, and lengths are coherent).
- Verify F1-C addressing: DU `127.0.0.3` to CU `127.0.0.5` matches your CU bind/listen address. Ensure no local firewall is blocking SCTP.
- Confirm rfsim server is enabled by the gNB process and that UE? `rfsimulator_serveraddr` points to the gNB host IP/port (commonly `127.0.0.1:4043`).

      }
      /* other gNB parameters unchanged (TDD config, frequencies, TAC, etc.) */
    },

      "rf": {

      }
      /* UE parameters retained; ensure IMSI/PLMN match the gNB */
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after change:
- Start CU; confirm no `config_execcheck()` aborts and that F1-C listener and rfsim server are started (logs should show SCTP listening and rfsim server binding to 4043).
- Start DU; observe successful F1 Setup Response and transition past "waiting for F1 Setup Response??.
- Start UE; confirm successful TCP connect to rfsim server, SSB detection, PRACH, RRC setup.

Further analysis tools if issues persist:
- Enable higher OAI log levels for CONFIG, F1AP, SCTP, RRC.
- Use `ss -lntp | grep 4043` and `ss -lnp | grep sctp` to verify listeners; check firewall rules.
- Validate NGAP (if AMF used) addressing and PLMN consistency end-to-end.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and anonymized; precise `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` JSON not fully provided. The MCC error indicates additional invalid fields beyond `gNB_ID` may exist; they also need correction.
- The gNB ID length in practice depends on profile (e.g., NGAP gNB ID is typically 22 bits). The recommendation uses a conservative upper bound (`0x3FFFFF`) consistent with common deployments and OAI practice; consult your specific OAI version? config validation for exact limits.
- The diagnosis leans on the supplied misconfigured parameter as the primary root cause, which aligns with the observed cross-component symptoms (CU abort ??DU/UE connection refused).
