## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

I assume OAI 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode using `--rfsim` based on CU/DU logs showing SA initialization and UE attempting to connect to the rfsimulator on `127.0.0.1:4043`. The expected bring-up: CU initializes and exposes F1-C server → DU connects via SCTP and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio (rfsim server) → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB detection/PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.

Key given misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. Per 3GPP NR, `gNB-ID` uses up to 22 bits. The maximum valid value is `0x3FFFFF` (4194303). `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) exceeds the 22-bit range and is invalid. In OAI, invalid identity parameters in `gnb.conf` typically cause early config parsing failures or prevent proper initialization of F1/N2 stacks.

From the provided logs and structure:
- CU shows only early initialization lines and a configuration error: bad `drb_ciphering` value. There is no evidence of CU F1-C listener accepting connections.
- DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect to CU (`Connection refused`) and waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
- UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` (errno 111), consistent with DU not starting rfsim server (since it’s blocked waiting for F1 setup).

Implication: A CU-side configuration error prevents F1-C from coming up. The misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is the guiding root-cause; the `drb_ciphering` error is an additional misconfig that would also block, but we prioritize the given misconfigured param as the primary fault.

Network config (summarized from the narrative, as full JSON isn’t pasted here beyond the misconfigured param):
- gnb_conf: contains `gNBs.gNB_ID` (invalid), likely F1 IPs (CU 127.0.0.5, DU 127.0.0.3 as per logs), TDD config (mu 1, N_RB 106, band 78 / 48 note in logs indicates 3619 MHz which maps to n78), rach and SIB params.
- ue_conf: SA mode, rfsimulator client to `127.0.0.1:4043`, syncs to 3619200000 Hz, mu 1, N_RB_DL 106.

Initial mismatch snapshot:
- `gNBs.gNB_ID` is invalid (>22 bits). This can cause CU-side failure → DU SCTP refused → UE rfsim connect refused. Secondary: `drb_ciphering` has an invalid value, also blocking.

I proceed with this causal chain as the central hypothesis.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Observed CU lines:
- SA mode, version hash, RAN context initialized for CU (L1/L2 disabled which is normal for CU).
- `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU` printed early by app.
- “SDAP layer is disabled”, “Data Radio Bearer count 1”.
- Error: `[RRC] in configuration file, bad drb_ciphering value 'invalid_yes_no', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed`.
- Config parsing messages (`Reading 'GNBSParams'`, `SCTPParams`, etc.).

What’s missing:
- No evidence of CU F1-C SCTP server listening/accepting, no NGAP connection to AMF printed, no F1 Setup handling.

Interpretation:
- Early-stage config errors (invalid `gNB_ID`, invalid `drb_ciphering`) likely prevent CU from completing initialization and starting F1-C server. Even though `gNB_CU_id` is logged as 3584 (decimal), this is an internal app ID; the `gNBs.gNB_ID` from the config is a distinct identity that must be valid per spec. Invalid identity may be rejected in config validation or used later to construct F1AP/NGAP identities, leading to abort.

Cross-reference with `gnb_conf` expectations:
- F1-C server bind would be configured under SCTP/F1AP params. Absence of bind/listen logs aligns with CU not reaching that stage due to config errors.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

DU shows a healthy PHY/MAC init:
- L1/MAC initialized, TDD pattern computed, frequencies match 3619200000 Hz, N_RB 106, SIB1 parameters printed, antenna ports, etc.
- F1AP client attempts: “F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5…”
- Repeated SCTP connect failures: `Connect failed: Connection refused`, followed by retries and “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio”.

Interpretation:
- DU can’t establish F1-C because CU-side server is not accepting, consistent with CU aborted or not initialized due to configuration errors (invalid `gNB_ID` and bad `drb_ciphering`).
- Because F1 Setup does not complete, DU does not activate radio nor start the rfsim server endpoint for UE.

Link to `gnb_conf` parameters:
- The DU’s F1-C target matches logs; no DU-side fatal error appears. The blocking condition is upstream at CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

UE initialization is normal until access to rfsim server:
- Frequency/N_RB settings consistent with DU logs (3619200000 Hz, N_RB 106, mu 1).
- UE acts as rfsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- All attempts fail with errno(111) (connection refused), indicating no server is listening.

Interpretation:
- In OAI rfsim, the DU acts as the rfsim server. Since DU is waiting for F1 Setup (which fails due to CU-side bring-up failure), the rfsim server never starts, so UE can’t connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU encounters configuration errors early and never brings up F1-C.
- DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect (refused) and remains idle waiting for F1 Setup, thus not activating radio or rfsim server.
- UE can’t connect to rfsim server and stalls.

Root cause guided by misconfigured param:
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid (exceeds 22-bit `gNB-ID` length defined in NR). OAI likely rejects this in config validation or at identity encoding for F1/NG interfaces, preventing proper initialization of CU. This singular misconfiguration is sufficient to cause CU not to start F1-C, cascading to DU/UE failures observed.
- Secondary misconfig: `drb_ciphering='invalid_yes_no'` (must be `yes` or `no`). Even if `gNB_ID` were corrected, this would also block CU RRC config. Both must be fixed, but the primary ticketed root cause is the invalid `gNB_ID`.

Spec/OAI knowledge:
- 3GPP 38.300/38.413/38.331/38.304 family: `gNB-ID` is at most 22 bits. Max value `0x3FFFFF`.
- OAI config parsers and RRC/F1AP layers validate identity ranges; out-of-range values lead to errors or aborts.

Therefore: The misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` caused the CU not to fully initialize F1-C, resulting in DU SCTP connection refused and UE rfsim connection refused. The `drb_ciphering` misconfig compounds the failure.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid 22-bit value. Since logs show internal IDs as 3584 (0xE00), use a compliant value like `0x00000E00` or any unique value ≤ `0x3FFFFF` consistent across CU/DU where required.
- Correct `drb_ciphering` to `yes` or `no` (typical: `yes`).

Post-fix expected behavior:
- CU should complete initialization, bind and listen on F1-C.
- DU should establish SCTP, receive F1 Setup Response, and activate radio; rfsim server starts.
- UE should connect to rfsim server and proceed to SSB detection, RACH, and RRC attach.

Additional validation steps:
- Verify CU logs include F1-C listening and NGAP (if core present) or at least F1 Setup handling.
- Confirm DU logs show successful F1 Setup and radio activation.
- Observe UE successful connection to rfsim server and subsequent RRC messages.

Corrected configuration snippets (JSON-style with comments):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        // FIX: gNB_ID must be ≤ 22 bits (max 0x3FFFFF). 0xFFFFFFFF is invalid.
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000E00", // chosen to align with logged internal id 3584
        // ... other existing gNB settings ...
        // FIX: drb_ciphering must be "yes" or "no" only
        "drb_ciphering": "yes"
      },
      "F1AP": {
        // Ensure CU listens on expected IP/port per your environment
        "CU_f1c_ip": "127.0.0.5",
        "DU_f1c_ip": "127.0.0.3"
      },
      "NR": {
        // Keep existing validated radio params; not changed by this fix
        "ssb": { "absoluteFrequencySSB": 641280 },

      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        // UE rfsim client to local DU server (unchanged)
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043
      },
      "phy": {
        // Keep aligned with gNB
        "dl_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "ssb_subcarrier_spacing": 30e3,
        "n_rb_dl": 106
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational guidance:
- After editing, re-run CU first, confirm it reaches F1-C listening. Then start DU, ensure F1 Setup completes. Finally start UE.
- If further failures occur, enable higher logging for `RRC`, `F1AP`, and config parsing; check that PLMN/MCC/MNC lengths and TAC are consistent with your core (if present).

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated; CU logs stop at early parsing without explicit fatal message, so attribution to `gNB_ID` relies on known constraints and provided misconfigured parameter. The invalid `drb_ciphering` also independently explains CU abort. Both should be fixed to ensure progress.
- Full `network_config` JSON was not included; the snippet shows only fields relevant to the fix. Ensure other identity fields (PLMN, cellIdentity length) remain compliant.
