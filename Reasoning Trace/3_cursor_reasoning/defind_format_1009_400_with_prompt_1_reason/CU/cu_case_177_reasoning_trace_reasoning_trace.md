## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The logs indicate OAI NR SA mode with RFsim (`--rfsim --sa`). Expected bring-up: CU starts (NGAP off in rfsim-only runs), DU connects to CU over F1-C (SCTP), CU/Du initialize PHY/MAC, UE connects to the RFsim server (default 127.0.0.1:4043), PRACH/RRC procedures, and eventual registration.
- The DU shows full PHY/MAC init and repeatedly attempts F1-C SCTP to the CU at `127.0.0.5` → “Connection refused,” meaning no server is listening on the CU side yet.
- The UE repeatedly attempts to connect to the RFsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails with `errno(111)`, consistent with the gNB side not being fully up.
- Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In NR, `gNB_ID` is limited (typically up to 22 bits per 3GPP TS 38.300/38.413 split and OAI constraints). `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds allowed range and is invalid.
- No explicit `network_config` JSON was included; we infer gNB/UE key parameters from logs:
  - DU shows band/N_RB/SSB numerology consistent across UE logs: DL 3619.2 MHz, N_RB 106, μ=1. TDD config present.
  - DU F1-C target CU IP: `127.0.0.5`; DU local F1-C: `127.0.0.3`.

Implication: An invalid `gNB_ID` prevents CU from completing configuration and starting F1AP (SCTP server). As a result, DU’s F1-C connection is refused, and UE’s RFsim client cannot connect to a running gNB server.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode and loads config. Notable message: `unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9"` (warning; CU typically supports nea0/1/2). This alone would not block F1AP standing up if ignored.
- CU prints `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU`, but there is no subsequent evidence that F1AP server starts (no SCTP listen logs, no F1 Setup response handling). Logs end after repeated “Reading 'GNBSParams' section…” lines.
- Absence of F1AP/SCTP listening on CU aligns with DU’s repeated `Connection refused` when trying to connect.
- Given the misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, CU likely rejects or fails to initialize the F1 entity cleanly. OAI config parsing accepts the file (`config_libconfig_init returned 0`) but later validation or ID derivation blocks F1AP bring-up.

Conclusion: CU does not expose the F1-C server due to invalid `gNB_ID`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC fully, configures TDD patterns, band 48/78-style numerics, and SIB1 params; it progresses to networking threads.
- DU then starts F1AP client: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated failures: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by F1AP retries. “Waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio” remains. This indicates the DU is functional, but the peer (CU) does not have a listening SCTP endpoint.
- No PRACH/MAC/PHY error asserts are seen; the DU stalls only due to control-plane unreachability.

Conclusion: DU is blocked on F1-C because CU is not listening; this is upstream of DU and consistent with a CU-side config error.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config matches DU PHY: `DL freq 3619200000`, `N_RB_DL 106`, μ=1.
- UE is an RFsim client and repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)`.
- In OAI RFsim, the gNB typically runs the RFsim server; if CU/DU stack is not fully active (F1 not up, radio not activated), the RFsim server won’t accept connections. Hence UE cannot attach.

Conclusion: UE failures are a downstream symptom of the CU not bringing up services due to invalid `gNB_ID`.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation: CU loads config but never exposes F1AP listen → DU F1-C connect refused → UE RFsim connect refused. The first break occurs on the CU.
- The misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid for OAI NR. OAI expects a gNB ID within the allowed bit-length (commonly ≤ 22 bits: max `0x3FFFFF`). `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit) exceeds this range and may also conflict with internal masks/ASN.1 encodings used for gNB/NRCellID derivations.
- Therefore, CU fails to initialize F1 properly and does not start the SCTP server. All subsequent failures (DU connect refused, UE RFsim connect refused) cascade from this.

Root cause: Invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` (out-of-range), preventing CU F1AP bring-up.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix: Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within the expected range (e.g., 22-bit). Since logs show `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, use a consistent, valid ID like `0x00000E00` (3584) or any `≤ 0x003FFFFF`.
- Ensure DU’s `gNBs.gNB_ID` (if present) and cell identity components remain consistent with the CU where required by OAI (CU/DU IDs may be distinct but must be valid and compatible with F1 setup).
- Optional: Correct the ciphering algorithm to a supported one (e.g., `nea2`) to avoid spurious warnings.
- After change, verify CU logs contain F1AP server start/listen, DU obtains F1 Setup Response, and UE can connect to RFsim server.

Proposed corrected snippets (representative, since full `network_config` JSON was not provided):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000E00",  // valid 22-bit ID (3584), replaces 0xFFFFFFFF
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
        "F1C": {
          "CU_bind_address": "127.0.0.5",
          "DU_connect_address": "127.0.0.3"
        },
        "security": {
          "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea2"],  // avoid unsupported "nea9"
          "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2"]
        }
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",  // unchanged; will succeed once gNB is up
      "frequency": 3619200000,
      "numerology": 1,
      "N_RB_DL": 106
    }
  }
}
```

Validation steps after applying fix:
- Start CU; confirm log shows F1AP/SCTP listening (no config parsing loops or ID errors).
- Start DU; confirm F1 Setup completes (no `Connection refused`).
- Start UE; confirm RFsim connection established and PRACH/RRC procedures begin.

## 7. Limitations
- The provided JSON did not include an explicit `network_config` object; corrections above are representative and assume standard OAI fields.
- Logs are truncated and lack explicit CU error lines about `gNB_ID`; diagnosis is based on known OAI constraints and the explicit misconfigured parameter.
- Specification references: In NR, gNB ID sizing commonly follows 3GPP constraints (e.g., up to 22 bits); OAI enforces bounded IDs for encoding/derivation. An out-of-range `gNB_ID` is a known cause for early control-plane bring-up failures.
