## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The setup is OAI 5G NR Standalone using RF Simulator, evidenced by CU/DU logs showing `--rfsim` and `--sa` and UE logs using RFSIM `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected flow: initialize CU and DU → CU listens for F1-C SCTP → DU connects F1AP to CU → CU activates radio → RFsim server becomes available → UE connects to RFsim → SIB/PRACH → RRC attach → NGAP/PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- Key observation from logs:
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (`Connection refused`) and waits for “F1 Setup Response before activating radio”. This explains why the RFsim server never comes up and why the UE can’t connect (`errno(111) connection refused`).
  - CU log shows config reading but no evidence it opened F1-C; also an `RRC unknown integrity algorithm "0"` warning suggests config issues.

Assumptions about network_config (gnb/ue):
- `gnb_conf` contains `gNBs.gNB_ID` and likely a gNB ID bit-length (OAI commonly uses 22-bit gNB ID by default) and F1-C IPs (DU → 127.0.0.3, CU → 127.0.0.5 in logs).
- `ue_conf` sets RFsim address/port, frequency ~3619.2 MHz (Band n78/n48 style values seen across logs).

Early mismatch guided by misconfigured_param:
- In 5G NR, the NG-RAN `gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING of length 22..32 bits (3GPP TS 38.413 NGAP GlobalGNB-ID). OAI typically requires that the numeric value fit the configured bit-length. Setting `0xFFFFFFFF` (all ones, 32-bit) while the platform expects 22 bits causes overflow/range validation failures in CU side identity setup, preventing F1 from coming up.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Initialization in SA mode with rfsim is confirmed. CU prints version and begins reading config sections (`GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, etc.).
- Warning: `RRC unknown integrity algorithm "0"` indicates a bad `security` section, but this alone doesn’t typically block F1 listener creation; however, it confirms config problems exist.
- Notably absent: lines showing CU starting SCTP server for F1-C or accepting a DU F1AP association. In parallel, the DU attempts to connect and gets `Connection refused`. This strongly indicates CU failed earlier in initialization (likely in identity/NG setup) and never bound the F1-C SCTP socket.
- Cross-reference with misconfigured gNB ID: If CU rejects `gNB_ID` during identity derivation/ASN.1 encoding, it would abort or skip F1 initialization → DU sees refusal.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC and prepares F1AP:
  - Frequencies and numerology match UE (DL 3619200000 Hz, µ=1, N_RB=106).
  - TDD configuration established; radio activation is gated: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- DU starts F1AP and tries to connect to CU at `127.0.0.5` from DU `127.0.0.3`:
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by “retrying…”. This is consistent with CU not listening.
- Because F1 Setup never completes, DU does not activate radio and does not start RFsim server-side for the UE.
- This behavior is consistent with an upstream CU configuration error blocking F1.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes with matching RF numerology and frequencies (µ=1, 106 PRBs, DL=3619200000 Hz), and then tries to connect to RFsim server `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- It repeatedly fails with `errno(111)` connection refused.
- This is a consequence, not the cause: since DU never received F1 Setup Response, it never activates radio or brings up the RFsim server socket, so the UE can’t connect.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU reads config but never opens F1-C listener (no log of F1AP server). DU immediately attempts SCTP and gets `Connection refused`. DU blocks waiting for F1 Setup Response → no radio activation → no RFsim server → UE connection attempts fail.
- Guided by the misconfigured parameter:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is incompatible with the configured gNB ID bit-length (OAI commonly defaults to 22 bits). Per 3GPP, gNB-ID is 22..32 bits, but OAI requires that the numeric value be representable in the selected bit-length; using 0xFFFFFFFF when `gNB_id_bits=22` overflows. Many OAI code paths validate this and will error out early (e.g., when building NG/F1 identifiers and SIB encodings), preventing F1 from starting.
  - Secondary config issue noted (`integrity algorithm "0"`) may also be present but is not necessary to explain the F1 listener absence; the gNB ID overflow is sufficient and aligns with the provided “misconfigured_param”.
- Root cause: invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` value relative to bit-length expectations leads to CU initialization failure before F1AP server bind/listen, cascading to DU SCTP refusal and UE RFsim connection refusal.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix the gNB identity so the numeric value fits the configured bit-length and is consistent across CU/DU:
  - Use a small integer (e.g., `0x00000A`) with `gNB_id_bits: 22` (or increase the bit-length to 32 and keep a reasonable value, avoiding “all ones” which is often treated as invalid/sentinel by implementations).
  - Ensure the same PLMN/MCC/MNC and `gNB_id_bits` are used consistently across CU and DU.
- Address the security config warning by selecting a supported integrity algorithm (e.g., `nia2`) and ciphering (e.g., `nea2`).
- After updating CU config, verify CU logs show F1-C listener and F1 Setup handling; DU should then stop retrying and proceed to activate radio, which will bring up RFsim server for UE to connect.

Corrected configuration snippets (illustrative within the same `network_config` structure):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "plmn_list": [{ "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" }],
        "gNB_id_bits": 22,              // ensure 22-bit identity per OAI default
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000A"          // FIX: fits 22-bit range; avoid all-ones
      },
      "security": {
        "integrity": "nia2",          // FIX: replace invalid "0" with supported algorithm
        "ciphering": "nea2"
      },
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_f1c_listen_ip": "127.0.0.5", // CU should bind/listen here
        "DU_f1c_connect_ip": "127.0.0.3"  // DU connects from here
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
      "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
      "frequency": 3619200000,
      "numerology": 1,
      "N_RB_DL": 106
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after change:
- Start CU and confirm logs show F1AP server binding and waiting for DU.
- Start DU and confirm F1 SCTP association success, F1 Setup Request/Response exchange, then radio activation.
- Confirm UE connects to RFsim server, detects SSB/SIB1, and proceeds with RRC attach.


## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not show explicit CU F1-C listener failure messages; the conclusion is inferred from DU’s `Connection refused` and absence of CU F1AP activity plus the known invalid `gNB_ID` parameter.
- The exact `gNB_id_bits` in the provided `gnb_conf` JSON is not shown; recommendation assumes OAI’s common 22-bit default. If using a different bit-length, choose a `gNB_ID` value that fits that length and keep CU/DU consistent.
- Security algorithm warning is noted but treated as secondary; if issues persist after fixing `gNB_ID`, correct the security section as shown.

High-signal chain-of-causality: Mis-sized `gNB_ID` blocks CU identity setup → CU never opens F1-C → DU SCTP refused and blocks radio activation → RFsim server never appears → UE’s repeated `errno(111)` connection failures.
