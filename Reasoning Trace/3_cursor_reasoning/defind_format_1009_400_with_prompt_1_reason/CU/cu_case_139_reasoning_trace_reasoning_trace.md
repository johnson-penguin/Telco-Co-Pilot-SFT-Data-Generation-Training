## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs indicate OAI NR SA with `--rfsim` (RF simulator) and TDD config. Expected control/data flow: component init → F1AP (DU↔CU) setup → CU NGAP towards AMF (not shown here) → DU radio activation → UE attaches via RACH/SIB/RRC → PDU session.
- The DU repeatedly fails to establish F1-C SCTP to the CU at `127.0.0.5` and stays in “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.” The UE, acting as RFsim client, cannot connect to RFsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043`, because the DU never transitions to the active radio state.
- Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In NR, the gNB-ID is limited to 22 bits (range 0..(2^22-1)); `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all ones) is out-of-range and invalid per 3GPP identity constraints and OAI validation. This commonly prevents successful F1/NG stack bring-up.
- Network configuration (from gnb_conf/ue_conf) is assumed consistent with the logs’ band (n78 around 3619.2 MHz), numerology µ=1, N_RB=106, TDD periodicity, and RFsim addresses. Any mismatches secondary to the invalid gNB ID are considered downstream effects.

Key parameters observed in logs vs config:
- DU: `gNB_DU_id 3584` appears derived/normalized internally despite an invalid configured `gNB_ID`, but CU-side likely rejects/never binds F1 due to config failure → DU’s SCTP connection refused.
- UE: RF and numerology align with DU’s values; primary blocker is absent RFsim server (DU not up), not PHY mismatches.

Conclusion of setup: The invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` halts CU control-plane bring-up, which cascades to DU F1 retry loop and UE RFsim connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU starts in SA mode with RFsim and loads config file. It prints:
  - RAN context initialized for CU-split (no MAC/L1 instances at CU, expected).
  - `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and name present, but there is no subsequent F1AP listener “Starting F1AP at CU” or SCTP bind logs; instead, only config-section reads appear.
  - Warning: `unknown integrity algorithm ""` (often benign if security left empty in tests).
- Notably absent:
  - SCTP server bind/listen for F1-C, any NGAP towards AMF, or F1 Setup handling → suggests CU initialization did not reach F1AP task activation, consistent with config validation failure.
- Cross-reference: With `gNBs.gNB_ID` invalid, OAI typically fails at identity/PLMN/CellID composition or F1AP setup, stopping before binding SCTP server. That fits CU silence on F1.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC fully: numerology µ=1, N_RB=106, TDD config, SIB1 TDA, antenna ports, frequencies: `DL/UL 3619200000 Hz` (n78-like). This shows DU’s local radio configuration is coherent.
- Control-plane:
  - DU starts F1AP client and attempts SCTP connect to CU `127.0.0.5` from local `127.0.0.3`.
  - Repeated: `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and “Received unsuccessful result… retrying…”.
  - DU stays in `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → radio not activated, RFsim server not created.
- Interpretation: CU isn’t listening on F1-C (due to earlier CU failure). DU behavior is a direct consequence.
- Link to misconfig: An out-of-range `gNB_ID` at CU side prevents F1 server bring-up, making all DU client attempts fail.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE PHY matches DU settings (µ=1, N_RB=106, TDD, same center frequency). No PRACH/MAC errors shown.
- UE acts as RFsim client and repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`:
  - `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)` repeated.
- Root reason: DU never activated radio (due to missing F1 Setup), hence the RFsim server endpoint is not open; UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU: configuration read completes but no F1/NG activation logs → likely aborted due to invalid identity parameter.
  - DU: continuously retries F1-C SCTP to CU → confirms CU not listening.
  - UE: cannot connect to RFsim server → DU radio not active without F1 Setup.
- Misconfigured parameter guidance: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds NR gNB-ID bit-length (22 bits). Per 3GPP (e.g., TS 38.413/38.300 identity composition with 22-bit gNB-ID within global gNB ID) and common OAI checks, such values are rejected or lead to inconsistent derived IDs. Result: CU F1AP server initialization is not reached; the system stalls exactly as observed.

Root cause: Out-of-range `gNBs.gNB_ID` causes CU initialization failure prior to F1AP server bind, cascading to DU F1 connect refusals and UE RFsim connection failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid 22-bit value and ensure consistency across CU/DU where applicable. Typical safe values: small integers (e.g., `0x000001`), ensuring uniqueness within the deployment.

Suggested corrected snippets (illustrative within the same network_config structure):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001",  // Fixed: within 22-bit range (<= 0x3FFFFF)
        "gNB_Name": "gNB-Eurecom",
        "PLMN": { "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" },
        "ngran_mode": "SA",
        "rfSim": true,
        "F1C": { "CU_IP": "127.0.0.5", "DU_IP": "127.0.0.3", "Port": 38472 },
        "NRARFCN_DL": 641280,
        "band": 78,
        "subcarrierSpacing": 30,
        "N_RB_DL": 106,
        "tdd_ul_dl_configuration_common": {
          "dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity": "5ms",
          "nrofDownlinkSlots": 8,
          "nrofUplinkSlots": 3
        }
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "imsi": "001010123456789",
      "rfSim": true,
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
      "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
      "NRARFCN_DL": 641280,
      "band": 78,
      "subcarrierSpacing": 30,
      "N_RB_DL": 106
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after the fix:
- Start CU: verify F1AP server bind/logs and NGAP towards AMF (if configured) appear.
- Start DU: confirm F1 Setup Request/Response completes; radio activation logs should follow; RFsim server opens.
- Start UE: confirm RFsim TCP connect succeeds, SSB/PRS sync, PRACH, RRC, and registration proceed.

Further diagnostics if issues persist:
- Validate PLMN, TAC, and CellID settings are consistent and within range.
- Ensure no duplicates of `gNB_ID` across multiple gNBs.
- If F1 still fails, enable higher verbosity for F1AP and SCTP and check for identity IE encoding errors.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps, so precise ordering is inferred.
- Full `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` JSON was not provided; the corrected snippet reflects reasonable defaults aligned to the logs.
- While the 22-bit constraint is standard (global gNB ID composition), actual OAI validation points may vary by version; however, the observed behavior strongly matches an identity-range failure at CU.
