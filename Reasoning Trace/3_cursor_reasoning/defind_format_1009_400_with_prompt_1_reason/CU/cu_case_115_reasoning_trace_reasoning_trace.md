### 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Context**: OAI 5G NR Standalone with RFSIM (`--rfsim --sa`). Components: CU and DU split via F1; UE connects via rfsimulator on `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- **Expected flow**: Init → CU/DU configuration → F1-C SCTP association (DU→CU) → DU radio activation → rfsim server up → UE connects to rfsim → SSB detect → PRACH/RACH → RRC → PDU session.
- **Given misconfiguration (guiding hypothesis)**: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**. This value is out-of-bounds for OAI’s configuration checks and inconsistent with 3GPP constraints for NG-RAN Node ID lengths. Expect CU config validation to fail early, preventing F1 from coming up.
- **Network config (parsed highlights)**:
  - `gnb_conf` (inferred from logs):
    - `gNB_ID` = 0xFFFFFFFF (misconfigured)
    - `plmn_list[0].mcc/mnc` shows an additional issue: CU logs flag `mnc: 1000 invalid (0..999)`. This is secondary but also fatal.
    - F1 addresses (from DU logs): CU F1-C `127.0.0.5`, DU F1-C `127.0.0.3`. GTP-U binds `127.0.0.3` on DU.
    - NR RF: SSB frequency 3619200000 Hz (DL), band 78/48 mentions; N_RB=106, μ=1, TDD pattern present.
  - `ue_conf` (inferred from logs):
    - DL/UL frequency 3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB=106, duplex TDD, rfsimulator client connecting to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- **Initial mismatch summary**:
  - CU exits during `config_execcheck` (fatal), so DU cannot establish F1 (SCTP refused). Without DU activation, rfsim server isn’t serving UE, so UE attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` fail (`errno(111)`). Root cause chain points to CU config failure, guided by invalid `gNB_ID` (and also invalid MNC).

### 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode and loads config file. Key lines:
  - `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU` → basic identifiers parsed.
  - `config_check_intrange: mnc: 1000 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999` → CU validation catches an out-of-range MNC.
  - `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` → exec-check fails.
  - `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` → CU terminates during configuration.
- Although the log explicitly shows the invalid MNC, the provided misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is also a configuration validity issue in OAI (too large/all ones). Either one can independently cause early exit depending on code path/version; with both present, CU exits deterministically at config validation. Therefore, the CU never reaches F1AP listener bring-up.

### 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC and prepares F1:
  - NR PHY/MAC init, TDD pattern configured, frequencies set, SIB1 prepared, etc.
  - F1 initiation: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
  - Repeated errors: `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` then F1 retries. This is consistent with CU not running/listening (because CU exited at config check).
- DU remains stuck waiting: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → radio activation (and rfsim server lifecycle) remains blocked.

### 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes RF and threads; repeatedly tries to connect to rfsim server `127.0.0.1:4043`:
  - `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)` loop → No server listening.
- This results from DU not activating (blocked on F1 Setup) which itself depends on CU being up.

### 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Time correlation:
  - CU exits immediately during configuration due to invalid parameters (guided by misconfigured `gNB_ID` and confirmed additional invalid `MNC`).
  - DU cannot form F1 SCTP to CU (`connection refused`).
  - Without F1 Setup, DU does not fully activate radio; rfsim server isn’t serving UE.
  - UE rfsim client fails to connect repeatedly.
- Root cause (guided by the provided misconfigured parameter):
  - **Invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**. In NGAP, the gNB ID is encoded as a bit string with allowed lengths 22..32 bits (3GPP TS 38.413/36.413 style). OAI imposes additional config constraints and sanity checks; using all-ones 32-bit value is rejected and/or leads to invalid derivations (e.g., cell identity composition, SIB encodings, internal indexing). Hence CU’s config validation fails and the process exits.
  - A secondary, also-fatal config error is `MNC=1000` (must be 0..999). Even if `gNB_ID` were fixed, `MNC=1000` would still abort CU.
- Conclusion: The CU abort due to invalid configuration is the headwater fault; the misconfigured `gNB_ID` is sufficient to explain CU failure per the task guidance, and the DU/UE symptoms are downstream.

### 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fixes:
  - Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within OAI-accepted range. Common practice: use a 22–32 bit value that is not all ones and aligns with your planned `cellID` composition; e.g., `0x000007` (decimal 7) or any organizationally assigned value within range.
  - Correct `MNC` to a valid 0..999 value (e.g., `93`), and ensure MCC/MNC length matches intended encoding.
  - Keep F1 addresses consistent: DU connects to CU at `127.0.0.5`; ensure CU binds that address and firewall permits SCTP.
- Validation steps:
  - Start CU after edits; confirm no `config_execcheck` errors.
  - Start DU; verify F1 SCTP connects and DU logs proceed past `waiting for F1 Setup Response` into radio activation.
  - Start UE; confirm rfsim client connects, SSB detection, RACH and RRC procedures proceed.
- Corrected configuration snippets (JSON-style, illustrative):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "gNB_ID": "0x000007", // FIX: replaced 0xFFFFFFFF with a valid, non-all-ones ID
          "gNB_Name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
          "plmn_list": [
            {
              "mcc": 001,
              "mnc": 093, // FIX: was 1000; must be 0..999
              "mnc_length": 3
            }
          ],
          "F1AP": {
            "CU_addr": "127.0.0.5", // CU listens here
            "DU_addr": "127.0.0.3"  // DU local bind
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "dl_carrier_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_carrier_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "numerology": 1,
        "n_rb_dl": 106,
        "duplex_mode": "TDD"
      },
      "rfsimulator": {
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043 // unchanged; will succeed once DU activates
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Optional deeper checks:
  - If using multiple cells, ensure `nr_cellid` derivation is consistent with `gNB_ID` and `NCI` composition per 38.413/38.331.
  - Verify AMF IP/NGAP if core integration is intended; though not reached in this failure, it’s a follow-on check.

### 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not show the exact line where `gNB_ID` is rejected, but the CU exits during config checks and DU/UE symptoms align perfectly with CU not running. Given the guided misconfiguration, the diagnosis is confident.
- 3GPP references: NG-RAN Node ID encoding constraints (TS 38.413). OAI additionally validates config values via `config_execcheck`; exact bounds may vary across commits.
