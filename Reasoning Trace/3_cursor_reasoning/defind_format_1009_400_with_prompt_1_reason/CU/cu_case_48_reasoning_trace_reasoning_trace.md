## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs indicate an OAI NR SA run with RF simulator: both CU and DU show SA mode; UE runs as RFsim client repeatedly attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected sequence: CU initializes and opens F1-C SCTP server → DU connects via F1AP and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio/rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim and proceeds with cell search, PRACH, RRC connection, NGAP/AMF, and PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`** in `gnb.conf`.
  - In 3GPP, the gNB ID is a BIT STRING of 22–32 bits (TS 38.413/38.472). OAI expects the configured `gNB_ID` to fit the chosen bit length and not violate internal masks used for CU/DU partitioning and cell identity derivations.
  - Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (all 32 bits set) is problematic: it collides with masks used for derived `NR_CELLID`, can overflow expected ranges when a shorter bit length is implied, and is treated as an invalid/sentinel value in some OAI code paths. Net effect: CU initialization does not progress to F1/NGAP bring-up.
- Network config (from the logs):
  - DU: SSB absolute frequency 641280 → 3619200000 Hz (n78-like), `mu=1`, `N_RB=106`, TDD config, normal.
  - IPs: F1-C DU binds `127.0.0.3`, connects to CU `127.0.0.5`. UE attempts rfsim to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Early mismatch hints:
  - CU shows a configuration error: invalid `drb_integrity` value, and repeated `Reading 'GNBSParams'` with no F1/NGAP startup lines.
  - DU sees repeated SCTP connection refused to CU. UE cannot connect to rfsim server.

Conclusion of setup: The CU likely aborted F1/NGAP bring-up because of an invalid `gNB_ID`, causing the DU to fail F1 setup and preventing the DU rfsim server from coming up, which in turn blocks the UE connection.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU confirms SA mode and build info; RAN context shows no MAC/RLC/L1/RU instances because CU role excludes PHY.
- F1AP identifiers printed: `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, and name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- Error: `in configuration file, bad drb_integrity value 'invalid_enum_value'` indicates an unrelated config issue, but CU continues parsing.
- After command line and config init, we see multiple `Reading 'GNBSParams' section` lines but no subsequent network bring-up like SCTP server for F1-C or NGAP towards AMF.
- Absence of typical CU messages (e.g., `Starting F1AP at CU`, `SCTP server listening`, `NGAP connecting to AMF`) suggests CU initialization halts before inter-process interfaces start. Given the provided misconfiguration, the `gNB_ID` is the primary blocker.

Relevance to config: An invalid `gNB_ID` can cause failure when deriving PLMN-scoped `NR_CELLID` and when populating F1AP/NGAP node identifiers, so CU will not expose the F1-C server, leading to downstream failures.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC/RRC parameters: TDD patterns, frequencies, bandwidth, antenna counts, etc., all normal.
- F1AP client attempts: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated failures: `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by `F1AP ... retrying`. DU stays in `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- Because F1 Setup never succeeds, DU does not transition to active radio; in rfsim mode this also means the DU does not start the rfsim server endpoint that the UE needs to connect to.

Link to misconfig: The DU side is healthy; the refusal stems from no listening SCTP server at the CU due to CU’s invalid `gNB_ID` configuration halting CU bring-up.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY consistent with DU (3619.2 MHz, `mu=1`, `N_RB=106`).
- The UE acts as an rfsim client: repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` connection refused.
- This is expected if the DU’s rfsim server never starts. As seen above, DU is blocked before radio activation because F1 Setup never completes with CU.

Conclusion: UE failure is a secondary effect of the CU-side misconfiguration.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU halts before opening F1-C and NGAP due to invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - DU attempts F1-C connection → refused repeatedly → DU remains in pre-activation state.
  - UE attempts rfsim connection to DU → refused repeatedly because DU server is not up.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured parameter: `gNB_ID` value all-ones is invalid for OAI’s expected bit-length/masks; it prevents proper construction of node and cell identifiers and stops CU from starting F1/NGAP services.
- Standards/OAI behavior:
  - TS 38.413 defines gNB ID as 22–32 bits. OAI often specifies the number of gNB ID bits and applies masks to derive `NR_CELLID`. Values exceeding the configured bit-length or special all-ones patterns can be rejected. Internally, OAI uses this ID for multiple interfaces (F1, NGAP, E2), so an out-of-range value causes early abort.

Hypothesis: Fixing `gNB_ID` to a valid, non-all-ones value within the chosen bit-length (e.g., 22–32 bits, commonly 24 or 28 in OAI examples) will allow CU to bring up F1/NGAP, enabling DU to complete F1 Setup and start rfsim, unblocking UE.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Change `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value that matches the configured gNB ID bit-length. Use a small decimal or hex value used in known-good OAI configs (e.g., `0x0000001A` or `3568`). Ensure CU and DU agree on cell identity derivations if needed.
- Also correct the unrelated `drb_integrity` field to `yes` or `no` to avoid future RRC config complaints.
- After fix, validate the sequence: CU logs should show F1-C server listening, DU should complete F1 Setup, `GNB_APP ... activating radio`, and UE should connect to rfsim and proceed with SSB detection and PRACH.

Proposed corrected snippets inside the `network_config` structure (JSON with explanatory comments):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      // Set gNB_ID to a valid non-all-ones value fitting 22–32 bits
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00001A2B", // CHANGED from 0xFFFFFFFF; safe 32-bit value
        "gNB_ID_bits": 28         // OPTIONAL: make explicit; must match OAI expectations
      },
      // Ensure integrity field uses valid enum
      "security": {
        "drb_integrity": "yes"   // CHANGED from invalid_enum_value
      },
      // Keep existing IP bindings consistent with logs
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_f1c_addr": "127.0.0.5",
        "DU_f1c_addr": "127.0.0.3"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change needed; UE failure is secondary to DU not serving rfsim
      "rf": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1:4043",
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "subcarrier_spacing_khz": 30,
        "bandwidth_prbs": 106
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after applying the fix:
- Restart CU and ensure logs include F1/NGAP bring-up; no early aborts after `GNBSParams` parsing.
- Start DU; observe successful SCTP association and F1 Setup. DU should log activation of radio and rfsim server.
- Start UE; rfsim connection should succeed; UE should detect SSB, perform PRACH, and proceed with RRC setup.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not include explicit CU fatal error lines. The inference relies on the provided misconfiguration and absence of expected CU F1/NGAP bring-up messages.
- Exact `gNB_ID_bits` used by the configuration is not shown; the recommended value assumes a common OAI setup (e.g., 28 bits). If a different bit-length is configured, choose a `gNB_ID` value that fits that length and is not all ones.
- UE and DU configs are partially inferred from logs; real `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` may include additional fields that should remain unchanged.

Final diagnosis: The CU `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid for OAI’s expected bit-length handling, preventing CU bring-up, which cascades to DU F1 connection refusals and UE rfsim connection failures. Correcting `gNB_ID` to a valid non-all-ones value resolves the issue.
