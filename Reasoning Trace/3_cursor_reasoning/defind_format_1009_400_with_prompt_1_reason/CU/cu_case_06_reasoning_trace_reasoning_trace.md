## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is an OAI 5G SA deployment running with RF simulator (`--rfsim --sa`). Components: CU, DU, UE. The expected sequence is: process startup → CU-F1C listener + NGAP init → DU F1 Setup towards CU → RF simulator server/client come up → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB/PRACH/RACH → RRC connection → registration and (later) PDU session setup.

Input highlights:
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- CU logs show config checks failing and softmodem exiting.
- DU logs show successful PHY/MAC init but repeated F1 SCTP connect failures to CU.
- UE logs show repeated RFsim client connection failures to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- No explicit `network_config` object was provided; we infer key params from logs: CU is in SA + rfsim; DU is TDD, band 78, DL 3619 MHz, N_RB 106; UE matches numerology/frequency. CU also reports `tracking_area_code: 0 invalid value` in addition to the gNB ID issue, but the guided misconfiguration is the `gNB_ID`.

Why `gNB_ID` matters: In 5GC, the NG-RAN node identity used in NGAP and SIB encodings uses a gNB-ID field limited to at most 22 bits (per 3GPP TS 38.413/38.300). Valid range is 0..0x3FFFFF. Setting `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits set) exceeds this, causing OAI config validation to fail before CU can start control-plane services.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key lines:
- `running in SA mode` and binary `nr-softmodem` with `--rfsim --sa -O ...cu_case_06.conf` confirm expected mode.
- `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 0 invalid value...` and `[CONFIG] ... section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` followed by `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` show that CU stops during configuration validation. Given the guided misconfiguration, the fatal one to focus on is `gNB_ID` out of range; TAC=0 is also invalid but would be easy to correct.

Effect: CU never binds F1-C SCTP nor NGAP SCTP; no F1 Setup Response will ever be produced.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Observations:
- DU completes PHY/MAC init: numerology µ=1, N_RB 106, band 48/78 reporting, SSB at 3619 MHz, TDD pattern built, threads started.
- DU attempts F1AP towards CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`, then repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and retries, and `[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` remains pending.

Link to CU: Because CU exited during config validation (invalid `gNB_ID`), there is no listener at `127.0.0.5` for F1-C, so DU’s repeated SCTP connection attempts are refused.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Observations:
- UE aligns with DL 3619 MHz, µ=1, N_RB 106; RFsim client attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` but repeatedly gets `errno(111)` (connection refused).

Link to DU: In OAI rfsim, the DU acts as RFsim server. Because DU is blocked waiting for F1 Setup Response (never received due to CU exit), it does not bring up RFsim server listening on 4043. Hence UE connection attempts fail.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU fails early at config validation due to out-of-range `gNB_ID` (and also TAC=0). CU exits → no F1-C endpoint.
- DU starts but cannot establish F1-C SCTP to CU; remains in retry loop; radio not activated.
- UE cannot connect to RFsim server since DU is not fully active; repeated connection refused.

Root cause: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds the 22-bit gNB-ID range allowed by 3GPP NGAP and used by OAI. OAI’s `config_execcheck` rejects it, exiting CU. This cascades to DU F1 failures and UE RFsim connection failures.

Standards/OAI grounding (external knowledge):
- 3GPP defines gNB-ID bit-lengths up to 32, but NG-RAN gNB-ID used by NGAP typically constrained to ≤22 bits in many deployments; OAI enforces 22-bit limit (0..0x3FFFFF). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` violates that constraint, triggering config check failure.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fixes:
- Set `gNB_ID` to a valid value within 0..0x3FFFFF and unique in your network (e.g., `0x00000001`).
- Also correct `tracking_area_code` from 0 to a valid value (e.g., 1..65533) to avoid a second validation error.

After applying fixes: start CU first (confirm it stays up and binds F1-C/NGAP), then start DU (verify F1 Setup completes, radio activates), then start UE (verify RFsim client connects and RRC attach proceeds).

Corrected configuration excerpts (illustrative, JSON-style with comments):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": 1,              // FIX: was 0xFFFFFFFF; now within 22-bit range (≤ 0x3FFFFF)
        "tracking_area_code": 1    // FIX: was 0; set to valid TAC
      },
      "F1": { "CU_addr": "127.0.0.5", "DU_addr": "127.0.0.3" },
      "rfsim": { "enabled": true }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": { "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000, "n_rb_dl": 106, "numerology": 1 },
      "rfsimulator": { "server_addr": "127.0.0.1", "server_port": 4043 }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks:
- CU logs: ensure no `config_execcheck()` exit; NGAP and F1 tasks should start.
- DU logs: F1 SCTP connects; receive F1 Setup Response; radio activates.
- UE logs: RFsim connect succeeds; SSB found; RACH and RRC connection proceed.

If issues persist:
- Confirm gNB-ID uniqueness and consistency across any split configs (CU/DU combined vs split).
- Verify no other invalid fields remain (e.g., PLMN/MCC/MNC lengths, SIB encodings).


## 7. Limitations
- The provided JSON lacks an explicit `network_config` object; parameter fixes are inferred from logs and the guided misconfiguration. CU logs also flag TAC=0 which must be fixed in addition to `gNB_ID`.
- Logs are truncated (no timestamps), so exact ordering is inferred. The reasoning is grounded in typical OAI control flow and the observed failure points.

Conclusion: Correcting `gNB_ID` to a valid ≤22-bit value (and TAC to a valid range) will allow CU to pass config checks, enabling F1 to establish, DU to activate RFsim server, and UE to connect and proceed with RRC.
