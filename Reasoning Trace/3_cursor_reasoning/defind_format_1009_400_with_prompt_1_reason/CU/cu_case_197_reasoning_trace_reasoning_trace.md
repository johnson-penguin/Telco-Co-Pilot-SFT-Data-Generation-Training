## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- **Scenario**: OAI 5G NR Standalone using RF Simulator (rfsim). All three components (CU, DU, UE) are launched. The CU log shows SA mode; DU shows F1AP client connecting to CU; UE attempts rfsim connection to port 4043.
- **Expected flow**: Initialization → F1-C association (DU↔CU over SCTP) → NGAP (CU↔AMF) → SIB broadcasting/PRACH → RRC connection → NAS registration → PDU session.
- **Given misconfiguration (guiding diagnosis)**: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`** in `gnb.conf`.
  - In 5G NGAP (TS 38.413) and RRC system information handling, `gNB_ID` is encoded as a bit string with a length 22..32. Using all-ones (0xFFFFFFFF) typically leads to masking/truncation or invalid identity; in OAI it may be further mapped to an internal macro gNB id, risking overflow/truncation and inconsistent IDs across subsystems.
- **Network config parsing (key params inferred from logs)**:
  - `gnb_conf` (from logs):
    - `gNBs.gNB_ID` → 0xFFFFFFFF (misconfigured).
    - `F1C CU` at 127.0.0.5; `F1C DU` at 127.0.0.3 (from DU log line: F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to CU 127.0.0.5).
    - `NGAP/AMF` address parsed as `abc.def.ghi.jkl` (invalid hostname).
    - TDD config present; SSB absoluteFrequencySSB=641280 (3619200000 Hz), N_RB_DL=106, µ=1, band 48/78 indicated.
    - `gNB_CU_id`/`gNB_DU_id` printed as 3584 (suspiciously derived/truncated value).
  - `ue_conf` (from logs):
    - RF: DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, µ=1, N_RB_DL=106, TDD, rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- **Initial mismatches/flags**:
  - CU immediately exits due to invalid AMF hostname, so F1 association is refused on DU, and UE cannot connect to rfsim server (because gNB is down). However, guided by the misconfigured parameter, even if AMF resolved, a `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` would yield an invalid/unsupported identity causing NGAP and possibly F1/RRC identity inconsistencies.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU starts in SA mode; creates NGAP, RRC, GTP-U threads; prints:
  - `NGAP Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584` → indicates CU maps `gNB_ID` to a macro gNB id of 3584 (0xE00), suggesting masking/truncation of the configured `0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - `Accepting new CU-UP ID 3584` and `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` – reinforces the truncated/derived value reused across subsystems.
- Failure point:
  - `getaddrinfo(abc.def.ghi.jkl) failed: Name or service not known` → assertion and exit in SCTP task during NGAP association setup to AMF. This is a separate misconfiguration (invalid AMF hostname/IP) that aborts the CU.
- Cross-reference with config:
  - The AMF endpoint must be a resolvable IP/hostname. The printed GTP-U bind `192.168.8.43:2152` suggests local data-plane configured, but control-plane to AMF is broken. Regardless, the suspicious `gNB_ID` mapping to 3584 means the identity used in `GlobalGNBID` may be out of expected ranges/length, risking later NGAP rejection.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC parameters correctly; frequency/timing align with CU’s band/SSB.
- F1AP startup shows:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with retries; `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- Cause: CU exited early; hence no F1 server listening, so DU cannot form F1-C.
- Identity notes: DU prints `gNB_DU_id 3584`. If `gNB_ID` is all-ones on the CU side, the CU-derived identity being 3584 may mismatch expectations. In OAI, F1 identities between CU/DU should be consistent and within expected bit lengths. The use of a saturated value (0xFFFFFFFF) is a red flag for undefined behavior, even if DU currently stalls for lack of CU.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes RF and threads; repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim server:
  - `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` → `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` (connection refused) loop.
- Cause: The gNB (DU/CU pair) never fully started/listened on the rfsim server port because CU crashed and DU never activated radio (blocked waiting for F1 setup). Thus, the UE has no server to connect to.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU aborts during NGAP due to invalid AMF hostname → DU cannot form F1-C (connection refused) → UE cannot connect to rfsim (server not up) → entire system idle.
- Guided by the misconfigured parameter (`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`):
  - 3GPP TS 38.413 (NGAP) specifies `GlobalGNBID.gNB-ID` as a bit string with allowed lengths 22–32. While 32-bit lengths permit up to `(2^32)-1`, practical implementations impose additional constraints: identities must be configured coherently across subsystems, and certain all-ones/sentinel values are not accepted. OAI also logs a "macro gNB id" abstraction; mapping `0xFFFFFFFF` to 3584 indicates internal masking/truncation (likely down to 20 bits or another mask), which can lead to:
    - Inconsistent `gNB_ID` between NGAP and F1/RRC layers.
    - Collisions with default IDs or invalid system information encoding (e.g., SIB1 cell identity derivations).
    - NGAP SetupFailure from AMF due to invalid or unexpected `GlobalGNBID`.
  - The CU log’s `macro gNB id 3584` and `gNB_CU_id 3584` strongly suggest non-intended identity due to overflow/truncation from `0xFFFFFFFF`.
- Root cause (primary, as requested by misconfigured_param):
  - **Invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` causes identity truncation/overflow, producing an invalid macro gNB id (3584) and risking NGAP/F1 identity mismatches and AMF rejection.** Even after fixing the AMF address, the system would likely fail NG Setup due to the invalid `gNB_ID`.
- Secondary blocker observed in logs:
  - **Invalid AMF hostname** (`abc.def.ghi.jkl`) immediately aborts CU. This must be corrected as well for any further signaling to proceed.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- **Fix 1 (Primary): Set a valid `gNBs.gNB_ID`**
  - Choose a non-saturated, unique value within the accepted bit-length. Common safe choices: a 22-bit or 32-bit value that doesn’t overflow internal masks, e.g., `0x00000E01` (3585) or another small, unique integer.
  - Ensure the same identity strategy is used consistently where required (CU/DU config alignment where applicable).

- **Fix 2 (Secondary but required): Correct the AMF endpoint**
  - Replace the invalid hostname with a resolvable IP/hostname; verify SCTP connectivity (port 38412 by default) and routing/firewall.

- **Operational checks**
  - After applying both fixes: start CU first (confirm NG Setup with AMF), then DU (confirm F1 Setup), then UE (confirm rfsim connection, SIB/PRACH, RRC, NAS).
  - Observe NGAP logs for `NG Setup Request`/`Setup Response`. Any `SetupFailure` with cause `miscellaneous/unspecified` or `protocol` may indicate remaining identity issues.

- **Proposed corrected snippets (JSON within network_config structure with comments)**

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000E01" // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a valid, non-saturated ID
      },
      "SCTPParams": {
        "AMF_HOSTNAME": "127.0.0.1" // changed from abc.def.ghi.jkl to a resolvable endpoint

        "N_RB_DL": 106,
        "duplexMode": "TDD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **Further analysis if issues persist**
  - Capture NGAP pcap and verify `GlobalGNBID` encoding (PLMN, `gNB-ID` length and value) against TS 38.413.
  - Check OAI logs for any warning about ID masking; search code paths mapping `gNBs.gNB_ID` to NGAP and F1 structures.
  - Validate no duplicate `gNB_ID` exists if multiple gNB instances are present.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; `network_config` was partially inferred from logs and the provided misconfigured parameter. The immediate CU crash is due to an invalid AMF hostname, which masks the later-stage failure that would likely stem from an invalid `gNB_ID` during NG Setup. Root-cause assertion here is guided by the supplied `misconfigured_param` and typical OAI handling of out-of-range identity values.
