### 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Scenario**: OAI NR SA with `--rfsim --sa`. Expected flow: CU and DU start → F1-C SCTP association (DU→CU) → CU NGAP towards AMF (not shown here) → DU activates radio → UE connects to rfsim server → PRACH/Random Access → RRC attach and PDU session.
- **Observed**: CU exits during configuration checks; DU keeps retrying F1 SCTP to CU; UE cannot connect to rfsim server (connection refused) because the gNB stack is not fully up. These are consistent with a CU-side fatal config error.
- **Guiding misconfiguration**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - In NG-RAN, NGAP `GlobalGNB-ID` uses a bit string of length 22..32 bits for `gNB-ID`. OAI also uses `gNB_ID` to derive cell/global identifiers and to coordinate CU/DU identities on F1/NGAP. An all-ones 32-bit value often violates internal range checks and/or mismatches expected bit-length, leading to identity encoding/validation failures and subsequent control-plane issues.
- **Network config JSON**: Not provided in this input; we infer typical `gnb.conf` fields (e.g., `gNBs[0].gNB_ID`, `tracking_area_code`, `plmn_list`, `ssb`, `tdd_ul_dl_configuration_common`, etc.) and `ue.conf` (RF frequency, rfsimulator address). We proceed with the known misconfiguration and logs.

### 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA+rfsim; version banner OK.
- Config validator reports: `config_check_intrange: sst: -1 invalid ...` followed by `config_execcheck ... wrong value` then immediate exit (`config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`).
- No evidence of NGAP or F1 coming up; CU never binds SCTP/F1 or connects to AMF.
- Cross-link to config: while the log explicitly flags `snssai.sst = -1`, the guiding issue is an invalid `gNB_ID`. OAI performs a batch of config checks; a single failure is enough to abort. In practice, setting `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` commonly triggers identity checks (range/bit-length) and can also cascade into other inconsistencies (e.g., derived IDs, section checks), so CU exit is consistent with a fatal config error in identifiers.

### 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC and prepares TDD configuration and radio parameters (DL 3619 MHz, N_RB 106, mu=1), then starts F1AP and attempts SCTP to CU at `127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with F1AP retry loop; DU is stuck waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
- This aligns with CU exiting early; the DU cannot complete F1 without CU.
- Identity perspective: even if the DU were to reach CU, an invalid CU `gNB_ID` would break F1 identity alignment (CU/DU `gNB_DU_id`/`gNB_CU_id` and `GlobalGNB-ID`), leading to F1 Setup failure. Here we do not reach that point because CU already exited.

### 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE RF params show 3619 MHz, mu=1; starts rfsim client connection attempts to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly; all fail with `errno(111)`.
- The rfsim server side is hosted by the gNB process; since DU is waiting on CU and CU exited, no server is accepting connections, hence persistent connect failures.

### 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU aborts due to configuration check failure (driven in this exercise by invalid `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, with another flagged error `sst=-1`).
  - DU cannot establish F1 to CU; remains in retry loop.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server; connection refused.
- Root cause (guided by misconfigured parameter):
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is outside OAI’s accepted range/bit-length semantics for gNB ID used in NGAP/F1 identity. NGAP `gNB-ID` must be a bit string length 22..32; OAI configurations typically expect a sane, not-all-ones, bounded integer (commonly within 20–28 bits, depending on build/options) and consistent with derived `nr_cellid` calculations. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` causes identity encoding/validation issues and/or triggers config checks to fail, making CU exit early.
  - Secondary config errors (e.g., `sst=-1`) can also independently cause abort. Even if `sst` were valid, the `gNB_ID` misconfiguration would surface later as F1/NGAP identity mismatch. Thus, the decisive fix path must include correcting `gNB_ID`.

### 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix identifiers:
  - Choose a valid `gNB_ID` within allowed bit-length and typical OAI expectations. Examples: 22-bit decimal like `1024` or a 28-bit value that is not all ones. Ensure consistency between CU and DU configurations.
  - Validate PLMN and S-NSSAI: set `sst` in `[0..255]` (e.g., `1`), and ensure `sd` is a valid 24-bit value if used.
- Connectivity sequencing:
  - Start CU successfully (config passes), then DU; verify F1 Setup completes; only then start UE.
- Verification steps:
  - On CU: confirm no config_execcheck errors; confirm NGAP/F1 logs show identity fields and successful SCTP associations.
  - On DU: observe `F1 Setup Response` then `activating radio` messages.
  - On UE: rfsim connects and PRACH occurs.

  }
}
```

- If your deployment uses separate CU/DU configs, ensure both contain compatible IDs (e.g., CU uses `gNB_ID=1024`; DU uses matching `gNB_DU_id` and aligned identities as per OAI examples). Avoid hex all-ones values.

### 7. Limitations
- The provided input lacks the concrete `network_config` object; fixes shown are representative and should be aligned with your exact schema.
- CU logs highlight an `sst=-1` error; although our guided root cause is `gNB_ID`, you should fix both to guarantee CU passes config checks.
- Specification notes are summarized from 3GPP NGAP/NR identity definitions; exact OAI acceptance ranges can vary by version. If uncertainty remains, inspect OAI config validation code for `gNB_ID` bounds and NGAP encoding of `GlobalGNB-ID` in your branch.
