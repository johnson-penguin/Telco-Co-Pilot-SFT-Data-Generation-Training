## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- Expected setup: OAI SA mode over RF simulator. DU logs show "running in SA mode" and rfsim usage is evident from UE attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (rfsimulator client). Normal flow: CU parses config → brings up NG/RRC/F1-C → DU F1-C connects → DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim → PRACH/RRC → registration.
- Given misconfiguration: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**. In NR, the `gNB-ID` is typically 22 bits (max `0x3FFFFF`). Setting `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds the allowed range and can also be rejected by OAI’s config/ASN.1 layers. If present in CU config, it can break config parsing/validation and F1 identity encoding.
- Observed high-level symptoms:
  - CU: libconfig error and init aborted — CU never starts.
  - DU: Repeated SCTP connection refused to F1-C CU — CU not listening.
  - UE: Repeated failures connecting to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` — DU never activates radio/rfsim because F1 Setup never completes.
- Network config JSON was not provided in this input, but from the misconfigured parameter, we infer `gnb_conf` contains `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` on the CU side (and possibly DU if shared). We proceed with that as the guiding signal.

Key parameters (inferred/expected from typical OAI configs):
- In `gnb_conf`:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID`: should be ≤ `0x3FFFFF` (22-bit). Set to `0xFFFFFFFF` (invalid).
  - `F1` addresses: CU often at 127.0.0.5, DU at 127.0.0.3 — matches DU logs.
  - TDD numerology/band/frequency consistent with DU/UE logs: n78-ish, DL=UL=3619.2 MHz, µ=1, N_RB=106.
- In `ue_conf`:
  - rfsimulator server address/port likely `127.0.0.1:4043` (from logs), band/frequencies aligned to DU.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

CU log highlights:
- `[LIBCONFIG] ... cu_case_88.conf - line 82: syntax error`
- `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`
- `init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed`
- `Getting configuration failed`
- `CMDLINE: ... nr-softmodem --rfsim --sa -O .../cu_case_88.conf`

Interpretation:
- The CU fails during configuration parsing, before any NG/F1 setup. This explains why the DU cannot establish SCTP to the CU (no listener) and why UE rfsim cannot find a server (DU never activates radio).
- Link to misconfigured parameter: an out-of-range or malformed `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` can cause libconfig validation or downstream parameter validation to fail. Even if hex syntax is allowed, OAI may validate the range and abort; some versions can surface as a “syntax error” at the offending line, especially if additional trailing tokens or overflow occur.
- Cross-reference expectations: If `AMF` and other CU-specific parameters were valid, we would at least see attempts to connect to AMF and to listen for F1-C; none appear due to early abort.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

DU log highlights:
- SA mode initialization; PHY/MAC/RRC parameters consistent with n78, µ=1, N_RB=106, DL=UL=3619.2 MHz.
- F1AP client attempts: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and `Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...`.
- DU reports: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` — so radio/rfsim server is not active.

Interpretation:
- DU is healthy up to F1-C setup. The CU-side listener is absent because CU aborted. Hence SCTP connection refused.
- No PRACH/MAC/PHY assertions appear; the DU is stalled waiting for F1 Setup. The root cause is upstream (CU config failure), not PHY.
- The DU’s view corroborates a CU-side configuration fatal error.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

UE log highlights:
- PHY matches DU settings: µ=1, N_RB=106, DL=UL=3619.2 MHz, TDD.
- `Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side` and repeated `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)`.

Interpretation:
- The UE cannot connect because the DU never started the rfsim server. DU defers radio/rfsim activation until after successful F1 Setup with the CU. Thus CU config failure cascades to DU and UE symptoms.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU aborts on config parse → no F1-C listener.
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (connection refused) → never activates radio/rfsim.
  - UE repeatedly fails TCP to rfsim server → cannot proceed to cell search/PRACH/RRC.
- Guided by the misconfigured parameter: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**.
  - 3GPP TS 38.413/38.473 (F1AP/NGAP identity aspects) and 38.300 architecture imply bounded identifiers. NR `gNB-ID` used in NR Cell Identity (NCI) is 22 bits (TS 38.211/38.331 context; NCI is 36-bit composed of gNB-ID up to 22 bits + cell identity up to 14 bits). Therefore the valid range for `gNB-ID` is `0..0x3FFFFF`.
  - OAI enforces limits; values exceeding 22 bits lead to failure at config checking or ASN.1 encoding. Some builds surface this as a config parse/validation error.
- Root cause: The CU configuration sets `gNBs.gNB_ID` to an invalid, out-of-range value (`0xFFFFFFFF`), causing CU initialization to fail at configuration time. This prevents F1-C from coming up, which in turn blocks DU and UE progress.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Actionable fix:
- Change `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid ≤22-bit value. Example: `0x000ABCDE` (decimal 703710) or simply `1`. Ensure uniqueness across the deployment and consistency where referenced.
- After fixing, verify CU starts, listens on F1-C, DU completes F1 Setup, DU activates radio, UE connects to rfsim, and RA/RRC proceeds.

Additional validation steps:
- Confirm no other syntax issues at the flagged line in CU config.
- Check any place where `gNB_ID` is used to derive `nr_cellid`/`NCI` — ensure cell identity bits stay within 36 bits total.
- Enable higher log verbosity for config: `config log level` in OAI, or run with `--log_config.global log_level debug` if available in your build.

        "duplex_mode": "TDD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checklist after change:
- Start CU → verify no libconfig errors; CU should listen for F1-C.
- Start DU → verify F1 Setup succeeds; DU logs “activating radio”.
- Start UE → verify TCP connect to rfsim succeeds, SSB detection, RA, RRC attach.


## 7. Limitations

- The input omits the full `network_config` JSON; the fix is deduced from the provided misconfigured parameter and logs. There might be additional config issues near CU config line 82 (e.g., trailing characters) that also require correction.
- Logs are truncated and lack precise timestamps; exact ordering is inferred from typical OAI flow.
- The validity bound for `gNB-ID` (≤22 bits) is based on 3GPP NR identity structure and OAI’s common enforcement; implementation specifics can differ slightly by branch. If issues persist, search project documentation and code for `gNB_ID` range checks and F1AP/NGAP identity encoding.
