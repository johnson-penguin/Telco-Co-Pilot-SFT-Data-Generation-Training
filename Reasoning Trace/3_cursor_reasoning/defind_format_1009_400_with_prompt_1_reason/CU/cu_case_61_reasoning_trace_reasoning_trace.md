## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs show an OAI 5G NR Standalone deployment using `--rfsim` with a split CU/DU and a simulated UE. Expected bring-up: process init → F1AP (DU↔CU) and NGAP (CU↔AMF) setup → DU activates radio after F1-Setup → UE connects to the DU’s RF simulator server, synchronizes to SSB, performs PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.

Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In NR, the Global gNB ID is signaled in NGAP (TS 38.413) using a BIT STRING of size 22..32. While 32-bit values are allowed by spec, OAI often applies additional masks/derivations (e.g., forming NCGI, cell IDs, or hashing to internal F1/NG identifiers). Setting all bits to 1 can trip validation, overflow, or create sentinel values that block control-plane bring-up.

Network configuration: explicit `network_config` JSON is not included in the input, but logs imply:
- CU/DU in SA TDD at 3619.2 MHz, `mu=1`, `N_RB=106`, band 78/48 labeling appears once (likely a benign logging quirk) with UL/DL offset 0.
- DU F1-C tries to connect to CU at `127.0.0.5` from `127.0.0.3`. UE tries to reach the RF simulator server at `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- CU log flags `unknown integrity algorithm "nia9"` which is invalid but not immediately fatal in OAI; the critical blocker is earlier control-plane readiness likely impacted by the gNB ID misconfiguration.

Initial mismatch signals tied to the misconfigured parameter:
- CU does not advertise starting F1AP/NGAP servers; DU repeatedly gets SCTP connection refused to CU’s F1-C endpoint.
- A pathological `gNB_ID` can prevent formation of valid GlobalGNB-ID/NCGI, causing the CU to skip/abort F1/NG setup.

Conclusion: Analyze each component to correlate symptoms back to `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode/version: SA with rfsim; branch `develop`.
- CU app context initializes, but there is no clear NGAP AMF connection log and no explicit “Starting F1AP at CU” line.
- Warning: `unknown integrity algorithm "nia9"` (OAI supports nia0/1/2 typically). This alone usually downgrades to supported algorithms but can prevent RRC security if strictly enforced. However, current failure happens before UE security.
- No SCTP server startup messages for F1-C are shown, no NGAP SCTP listener, and no AMF connection. This points to configuration parsing or semantic validation stopping control-plane bring-up.
- Cross-reference to `gNBs.gNB_ID`: CU must encode GlobalGNB-ID for NG Setup and may derive cell/NCGI-related values. An extreme/all-ones value can be rejected by OAI’s internal checks or cause inconsistent bit-length (22..32) handling, aborting NG/F1 initialization.

Interpretation: CU didn’t get to F1/NG socket setup, so DU’s connections are refused. Root cause candidate: invalid `gNB_ID` blocks initialization.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- PHY/MAC init is normal: TDD pattern calculation, frequencies at 3619.2 MHz, `N_RB=106`, `mu=1`, SIB1 parameters parsed, antennas set.
- F1AP client at DU starts and attempts SCTP to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by “retrying…”; DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
- No PRACH-related assertions or PHY crashes; the DU is simply held from activation due to missing F1 Setup with CU.

Interpretation: DU is healthy but blocked by CU’s refusal to accept SCTP (server not listening). This aligns with CU failing to start F1 due to configuration issues.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY and threads, attempts to connect to rfsim server `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly, all with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- This is expected if the DU has not activated the RF simulator server; DU only does this post F1 Setup Response, which is pending because CU isn’t accepting F1-C.

Interpretation: UE failures are downstream effects of DU not activating due to CU-side control-plane initialization failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline linkage:
  - CU: no evidence of NGAP/F1AP servers initialized.
  - DU: cannot connect to CU F1-C (connection refused) and thus cannot activate radio.
  - UE: cannot connect to DU’s rfsim server (connection refused).
- The misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is the prime suspect. Although NGAP allows 22..32-bit IDs, OAI often requires consistent sizing and masks in multiple places (GlobalGNB-ID encoding, NCGI construction, internal RC indexing, F1 identifiers). An all-ones 32-bit value can:
  - Violate OAI’s validation (e.g., expecting specific bit lengths or restricted ranges),
  - Collide with sentinel values used to indicate invalid/uninitialized IDs,
  - Produce inconsistent encodings when mapping to ASN.1 BIT STRING (size selection 22..32) leading to early aborts before sockets are brought up.

Therefore, the root cause is the invalid/extreme `gNBs.gNB_ID` value preventing CU control-plane initialization, cascading into DU SCTP refusals and UE rfsim connection failures.

Note: The `nia9` warning should be fixed later, but it does not explain the earlier SCTP server absence.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a sane, non-sentinel, properly sized value that OAI accepts for GlobalGNB-ID, e.g., `0x00000001` (or another site-unique value). Common practice is to use a value that fits comfortably within 22–32 bits without being all-zeros or all-ones and that matches planning for NCGI.

Secondary cleanups:
- Replace `nia9` with supported integrity algorithms (e.g., `nia2`); ensure ciphering `nea2`/`nea0` as appropriate.
- Verify CU/DU PLMN and TAC alignment, and confirm `F1AP` CU listener IP/port matches DU’s target (`127.0.0.5`).
- Ensure `rfsimulator` endpoints are enabled and that DU will open `4043` after F1 setup.

Suggested corrected snippets (representative; adapt to your actual `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf`). Comments explain changes:

    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {

      },
      "security": {

          "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",

        }
      },
      "cell_search": {
        "absFrequencySSB": 641280,  // aligns with DU logs (3619200000 Hz)
        "subcarrierSpacing": 30
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational validation after change:
- Start CU; confirm logs show F1AP and NGAP listeners created and AMF connection established.
- Start DU; verify F1 Setup completes; DU activates radio; `rfsimulator` server opens (4043).
- Start UE; confirm connection to 4043 succeeds, SSB sync, PRACH, RRC attach.

Deeper checks if problems persist:
- If CU still does not bring up listeners, search CU logs for ASN.1 encoding errors of GlobalGNB-ID/NCGI.
- Confirm the chosen `gNB_ID` length mapping (22..32) is consistent; if needed, choose a lower value (e.g., `0x000ABCDE`) that OAI shows in logs as the encoded size you expect.
- Verify AMF IP/NGAP settings in CU if NG setup stalls after fixing the ID.

## 7. Limitations
- The provided JSON lacks an explicit `network_config` object; corrected snippets are illustrative.
- Logs are truncated around CU control-plane startup; the absence of explicit F1/NG error messages suggests an early-return during config/ASN.1 preparation, consistent with a bad `gNB_ID`, but exact code path is not shown.
- Spec references: NGAP GlobalGNB-ID (TS 38.413) allows 22..32-bit IDs; OAI implementation may impose practical constraints and sentinel checks beyond the spec, making all-ones values unsafe.
