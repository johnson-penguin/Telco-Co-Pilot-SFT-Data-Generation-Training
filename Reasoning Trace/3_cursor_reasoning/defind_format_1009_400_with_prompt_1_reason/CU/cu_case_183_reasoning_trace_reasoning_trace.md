## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

This scenario shows an OpenAirInterface 5G NR Standalone deployment using the RF simulator. All three components (CU, DU, UE) run in SA mode (`--rfsim --sa`). The expected flow is: component initialization → F1-C association (DU↔CU) and NGAP (CU↔AMF) → DU activates radio/rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server → PRACH/RACH → RRC setup → PDU session.

The provided network configuration and misconfigured parameter indicate a critical identifier problem:
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`
- In NR, the gNB ID is a 22-bit identifier (maximum `0x3FFFFF`). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` overflows this field and should fail OAI’s configuration checks (as per 3GPP NGAP gNB-ID size definition and OAI config validation behavior).

Initial config/log cues:
- CU logs show configuration validation errors and an early exit.
- DU logs show repeated F1 connection attempts to the CU with “Connection refused,” then DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
- UE repeatedly attempts to connect to the rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused): the gNB rfsim server isn’t up yet.
- There is also a CU warning about `tracking_area_code: -1 invalid value`, but the guided root cause is the invalid `gNB_ID`.

Implication: With CU failing during configuration checks, the DU can’t complete F1 setup and therefore never activates the rfsim server; the UE then cannot connect.

Key network_config assumptions (typical for these logs):
- `gnb_conf` likely includes: `gNB_ID`, `tac`, F1 IPs (DU: `127.0.0.3`, CU: `127.0.0.5`), band/numerology consistent with logs (n78, µ=1, 106 PRBs, 3619.2 MHz).
- `ue_conf` likely includes RFsim client settings pointing to `127.0.0.1:4043` and matching band/frequency.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Highlights:
- Mode: SA.
- Early checks: `tracking_area_code: -1 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533` and `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`.
- After reading `GNBSParams`, CU aborts: `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.

Interpretation:
- CU’s configuration validation fails. Given the guided misconfigured parameter, `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds the 22-bit range and is rejected during `config_execcheck`. That alone is sufficient to cause an early exit. The invalid TAC compounds this but is not necessary to explain the failure.
- Because CU exits, it never opens the SCTP F1-C server socket for the DU and never progresses to NGAP/AMF.

Cross-check vs config:
- CU F1 server should listen on `127.0.0.5` per DU logs; no listener exists because CU exited on config check.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Highlights:
- Mode: SA. PHY/MAC initialize, SIB1, TDD pattern derived, RF parameters set (µ=1, N_RB=106, DL/UL 3619.2 MHz), F1AP starts, GTPU bound to `127.0.0.3`.
- F1-C: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by retries. DU logs: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

Interpretation:
- DU is healthy enough to attempt F1-C towards CU, but the CU process is not listening, so SCTP connection is refused.
- Because the DU is waiting for F1 Setup Response, it does not activate the radio nor bring up the rfsim server endpoint.

Link to gNB_ID issue:
- The gNB_ID misconfiguration occurs in the CU’s configuration and prevents CU startup; the DU behavior (connection refused) is a downstream effect.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Highlights:
- UE initializes RF to 3619.2 MHz, µ=1, 106 PRBs; threads start; UE runs as rfsim client.
- Repeated attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)`.

Interpretation:
- In OAI rfsim, the gNB side acts as the server endpoint. Since DU never activates radio due to missing F1 setup with CU, the server socket is not listening. Hence UE’s connection attempts are refused.

Link to gNB_ID issue:
- The UE failures are a cascading effect: CU exits → DU cannot complete F1 → DU does not start rfsim server → UE cannot connect.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Temporal chain:
  - CU exits on config validation (invalid `gNB_ID` and also bad `tac`).
  - DU repeatedly fails to connect F1-C to CU (connection refused) and waits for F1 Setup Response, so it does not activate radio/rfsim server.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim (`errno(111)`) because server isn’t up.
- Root cause: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is beyond the allowed 22-bit size (max `0x3FFFFF`). OAI’s `config_execcheck` rejects it, causing CU termination. This prevents F1 setup and rfsim activation, producing the observed DU and UE symptoms.
- Supporting standard knowledge: In NR, gNB-ID is encoded as a 22-bit field in NGAP; values exceeding this range are invalid for signaling and implementation data structures.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fixes:
- Set a valid 22-bit `gNB_ID` (e.g., `0x000001` to `0x3FFFFF`).
- Also correct TAC to a valid value (e.g., `1`). Though the guided root cause is `gNB_ID`, fixing TAC avoids subsequent NGAP/registration issues.

Post-fix checks:
- Restart CU → verify CU passes configuration checks and listens on F1-C.
- Start DU → verify SCTP F1 connects and DU logs show radio activation/rfsim server listening.
- Start UE → verify connection to `127.0.0.1:4043`, PRACH/RACH, RRC Setup, and PDU session establishment.

Corrected configuration snippets (embedded in the same network_config shape, JSON with brief comments for clarity):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001", // FIX: 22-bit max is 0x3FFFFF; 0xFFFFFFFF was invalid
        "tac": 1,               // FIX: valid range [1..65533]
        "F1AP": {
          "CU_IP": "127.0.0.5", // matches DU logs
          "DU_IP": "127.0.0.3"
        },
        "RF": {
          "band": 78,
          "absoluteFrequencySSB": 641280, // 3619200000 Hz
          "N_RB": 106,
          "mu": 1
        }
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator_clientaddr": "127.0.0.1",
      "rfsimulator_clientport": 4043,
      "RF": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "N_RB_DL": 106,
        "ssb_subcarrierSpacing": 30
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Further analysis if issues persist:
- Confirm CU actually starts NGAP towards AMF after F1 setup; fix any AMF address or PLMN/TAC mismatches.
- Verify DU activates the rfsim server after F1 Setup Response appears in logs.
- Check UE PLMN/IMSI and NSSAI to ensure registration proceeds beyond RRC Setup.


## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not include the full configuration JSONs; conclusions rely on typical OAI behavior and the guided misconfigured parameter.
- While TAC is also invalid (per CU log), the analysis is guided to emphasize `gNB_ID` as the decisive cause of CU exit and the downstream DU/UE failures.
