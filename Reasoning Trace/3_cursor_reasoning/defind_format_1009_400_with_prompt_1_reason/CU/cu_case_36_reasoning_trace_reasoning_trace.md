## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G Standalone deployment in RF simulation mode is being started, as shown by CU/DU logs including "--rfsim --sa". Expected bring-up flow:
- CU initializes, parses config, connects NGAP to core (if present), and starts F1-C to DU.
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC, starts F1-C to CU, and only activates radio (and rfsim server) after F1 Setup completes.
- UE starts, connects to the rfsim server (default 127.0.0.1:4043), performs cell search/SSB sync, PRACH, RRC connection, etc.

Provided misconfiguration: gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF. In 5G NR, the gNB ID is 22 bits (maximum 0x3FFFFF) per 3GPP (e.g., TS 38.413 Global RAN Node ID; gNB-ID size 22). Hence 0xFFFFFFFF is out of range and invalid. OAI’s config checker aborts on invalid values.

Network configuration (from logs and typical OAI defaults):
- gnb_conf: contains gNB_ID (misconfigured), PLMN list (also CU logs show invalid MCC 9999999), TDD config, absoluteFrequencySSB ~ 3619.2 MHz (band n78), N_RB 106, etc.
- ue_conf: UE tuned to DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, rfsimulator server set to 127.0.0.1:4043.

High-level mismatch: Invalid gNB ID causes CU config_execcheck to exit. Without CU, DU’s F1 connection is refused, preventing radio activation; consequently the rfsim server is not accepting connections, so UE connection attempts to 127.0.0.1:4043 fail with ECONNREFUSED.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key lines:
- "running in SA mode" and softmodem build info → normal startup.
- "F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584" and name → pre-F1 setup metadata.
- "config_check_intrange: mcc: 9999999 invalid value" and "config_execcheck: ... wrong value" → config validation errors.
- "config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun" → CU terminates due to config errors.

Interpretation:
- CU parses configuration and hits fatal validation errors. Although the log explicitly shows an invalid MCC, the provided misconfigured parameter gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF is also invalid and independently sufficient to make config checks fail. OAI exits early, so CU never brings up F1-C listener, and no NGAP/AMF step occurs.

Cross-reference with configuration:
- gNB ID must be ≤ 0x3FFFFF (22 bits). 0xFFFFFFFF violates range and is rejected by OAI’s config layer. This aligns with the observed immediate exit.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Key lines:
- Normal PHY/MAC/RRC initialization, n78 at 3619200000 Hz, N_RB 106, TDD pattern OK.
- F1AP: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" → DU attempts to connect to CU.
- Repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" and "Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3) ... retrying..."
- "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" → DU blocks radio activation until F1 Setup succeeds.

Interpretation:
- DU is healthy enough to attempt F1-C, but CU is down; hence SCTP connection refused. Because F1 Setup never completes, DU does not activate radio nor rfsim server-side timing/samples pipeline.

Link to misconfiguration:
- Root cause traces back to CU exit induced by invalid gNB ID (and/or other config issues). DU behavior is a downstream symptom.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Key lines:
- UE initialized at 3619200000 Hz (consistent with DU’s absoluteFrequencySSB 3619200000 Hz, band n78), N_RB_DL 106.
- "Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side".
- Repeated: "Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043" followed by "connect() ... failed, errno(111)".

Interpretation:
- The UE cannot connect to the rfsim server because DU did not activate the radio pipeline/server.
- This is consistent with DU awaiting F1 Setup, which never occurs since CU exited due to config errors caused by invalid gNB_ID.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU exits during configuration validation → F1-C listener is unavailable.
- DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (connection refused) and stays in "waiting for F1 Setup Response" → does not activate radio or rfsim server.
- UE’s repeated connect() ECONNREFUSED to 127.0.0.1:4043 → no server active from DU.

Root cause driven by misconfigured_param:
- gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF is invalid as gNB ID is a 22-bit field (max 0x3FFFFF). OAI config checks fail and terminate CU. This cascades to DU F1 failures and UE rfsim connection refusals.
- CU log’s invalid MCC is an additional misconfiguration, but even with MCC fixed, 0xFFFFFFFF gNB_ID alone would still cause failure.

External knowledge grounding:
- 3GPP specifies a 22-bit gNB-ID within Global RAN Node ID (e.g., 38.413) → valid range [0, 0x3FFFFF]. OAI implementations enforce this via config_execcheck.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid 22-bit value, e.g., 0x00000ABC (or keep existing site-specific value if previously valid) — must be ≤ 0x3FFFFF.
- Also correct PLMN fields (e.g., MCC must be 000–999, MNC length etc.) since CU logs show invalid MCC=9999999.

After correcting, validate:
- Start CU first; ensure it passes config checks and listens on F1-C.
- Start DU; confirm F1 setup completes and DU logs “activating radio” and rfsim server starts.
- Start UE; confirm TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 succeeds, SSB detection, PRACH, RRC connection.

Further analysis and guardrails:
- If issues persist, enable OAI config debug (`--log_config`) to see parameter acceptance and derived values.
- Verify CU F1-C listening IP/port matches DU’s target (e.g., CU 127.0.0.5, DU 127.0.0.3) and no firewall rules block SCTP.
- If multiple gNB instances, ensure unique `gNB_ID` per deployment and consistent PLMN across CU/DU.
- Validate with `tcpdump` on SCTP port (F1-C) and TCP 4043 (rfsim) to confirm state transitions.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not include the exact config file contents; CU shows an MCC error explicitly, but `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (provided misconfigured_param) is sufficient on its own to explain the observed cascade.
- Timestamps are not provided, so timeline ordering is inferred by typical OAI sequencing.
- The recommended values (e.g., example gNB_ID 0x00000ABC, PLMN) are placeholders; use site-specific, valid values as required.
