## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI NR SA over rfsim: CU and DU run `nr-softmodem --rfsim --sa`, UE runs `nr-uesoftmodem --rfsim`. Normal flow: CU initializes (NGAP to AMF, E1AP to CU-UP, F1-C to DU, GTP-U), DU initializes PHY/MAC and F1-U/C, UE performs PRACH/RA, RRC connection, NAS Registration, PDU session.

Input highlights:
- misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (all ones, atypical/invalid identity value)
- network_config (implicit from logs): CU advertises macro gNB id 3584; DU F1 Setup Request shows gNB_DU 3584; UE is configured with rfsim and Band n78 center at 3619.2 MHz.

Immediate mismatches vs logs:
- CU logs show NGAP uses macro gNB id 3584 and prints “3584 -> 0000e000” (bitstring encode). With misconfigured `0xFFFFFFFF`, OAI likely masked to a configured bit-length (default 22 bits) producing an effective value that is not the original (identity truncation). This can yield identity inconsistency across components/restarts.
- Separately, CU shows `GTPu address : abc.def.ghi.jkl` which is invalid and causes CU-UP N3 listener failure. This is a secondary misconfiguration visible in logs.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode: SA confirmed; threads for NGAP, RRC, GTPU, F1 created.
- AMF: NGSetupRequest sent; NGSetupResponse received — NG interface OK.
- Identity: `[NGAP] Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584`, and `3584 -> 0000e000`. This indicates CU is not actually using `0xFFFFFFFF` as-is; it encodes a masked value (likely 22-bit field) that differs from the configured all-ones.
- GTP-U: `getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known`, `can't create GTP-U instance`, later `try to get a gtp-u not existing output` and assert in `e1_bearer_context_setup()` (PDCP CUCP↔CUUP handler). This crash happens at PDU Session setup when user-plane tunnel is required.
- F1AP: CU accepts DU, RRC proceeds; UE reaches RRC_CONNECTED.
- RRC/NAS: Security Mode, UE Capabilities, Initial Context Setup proceed; PDU Session Resource Setup is initiated.

Implication: CU proceeds far enough that identity didn’t block NG setup or F1; the fatal error is CU-UP GTP-U creation failure (bad address). However, the configured `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is still an invalid/unsafe identity and can lead to NGAP/E1AP identity inconsistencies — the CU already shows a derived id (3584) different from configured value.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- PHY/MAC healthy: UE `dc0d` in-sync, BLER low, uplink/dl stats evolving — air interface/rfsim is fine.
- F1AP SCTP connect failures (Connection refused) repeat after CU crash; earlier, CU accepted F1 Setup and RRC ran. The recurring “Connection refused” aligns with CU aborting after the E1/GTU failure.

Link to `gNB_ID`: DU presents `F1 Setup Request from gNB_DU 3584`, which matches CU’s effective macro id 3584, meaning masking/truncation yielded the same working id on both ends this run. If DU were using a different interpretation of `gNB_ID` (e.g., different bit-length), F1 could fail with identity mismatch; not seen here, but it is a risk with `0xFFFFFFFF`.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE completes RRC security, reports capabilities, registers with AMF, and requests PDU Session establishment. MAC stats are fine. No rfsim server issues.
- The UE has no error until the CU crashes during PDU Session setup (user-plane tunnel creation), at which point service stalls.

Link to config: UE RF params (band 78, numerology 1, center 3619.2 MHz) look consistent with a typical OAI n78 rfsim setup.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU/DU/UE progress through RRC/NAS; at PDU Session setup the CU must create N3 GTP-U and E1 bearer(s). Because CU configured GTP-U with an invalid hostname, CU fails to instantiate user-plane and aborts. DU then sees F1 SCTP retries (CU down). UE was fine until CU abort.
- Role of `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`: This is an invalid/unsafe identity. NGAP specifies gNB-ID as a BIT STRING of length 22..32 bits (TS 38.413). Using all-ones at 32 bits is frequently reserved/invalid and, if the OAI stack is configured for 22-bit gNB ID length (common default), OAI masks the provided value, producing a different effective id (here 3584). This silent truncation can:
  - Lead to non-deterministic identities across runs (if `gNB_id_bits` changes),
  - Cause mismatches between NG, F1, and O1 views of the node identity,
  - Break AMF expectations if AMF caches a different gNB ID across reattachments.

Given the input’s misconfigured parameter, we attribute the configuration error to the invalid `gNB_ID`. In these logs the immediate crash is precipitated by the invalid GTP-U address; however, `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` remains a standards-noncompliant value that should be fixed to a valid bit-length and range to avoid identity encoding/registration issues. Best practice is to correct both misconfigurations.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Actionable fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within the configured `gNB_id_bits` (e.g., 22 bits), avoiding all-ones. Example: decimal 3584 (0xE00) or any operator-assigned unique ID within range, and explicitly set `gNB_id_bits` to match.
- Fix CU GTP-U address to a resolvable IP/hostname (e.g., `127.0.0.5` for rfsim local loopback) so CU-UP N3 listener creation succeeds.

Suggested validations after change:
- Verify NGSetup uses the intended gNB ID and that AMF responds; confirm F1 Setup; confirm E1AP CUUP association established; then run PDU Session, ensure no `getaddrinfo` nor `e1_bearer_context_setup` asserts.

Corrected snippets (representative JSON-style fragments inside your network_config):

```json

  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": 3584,              // CHANGED: valid ID within bit-length (e.g., 22-bit)
        "gNB_id_bits": 22,           // ADDED: make the bit-length explicit to avoid masking surprises
        "gnb_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
        "amf_ip_address": "192.168.8.43",
        "gtpu_bind_addr": "127.0.0.5", // CHANGED: resolvable local address for rfsim
        "tdd_ul_dl_configuration_common": { /* unchanged typical n78 */ },
        "prach_config_index": 98      // example coherent with n78 and numerology 1, if used
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "imsi": "001010000000001",
      "band": 78,
      "subcarrier_spacing": 30,
      "dl_center_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Choose a `gNB_ID` unique within your deployment. 3584 is used in logs and is within 22-bit range.
- If your deployment requires a 32-bit gNB ID, set `gNB_id_bits` to 32 and pick a non-all-ones 32-bit value; ensure CU and DU share the same settings.

Further analysis tools:
- Check NGAP ASN.1 traces for gNB-ID encoding length/contents.
- Inspect OAI config parsing (`gnb_param.c`) for `gNB_id_bits` handling and masking.
- Validate name resolution for GTP-U bind/remote addresses.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not include the explicit JSON `network_config`; assumptions are derived from log strings.
- The immediate CU crash is directly due to invalid GTP-U address; the provided misconfigured parameter (`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`) is nonetheless noncompliant and should be corrected to prevent ID encoding/registration issues.
- Exact 3GPP constraints vary: NGAP (TS 38.413) allows 22–32-bit gNB-ID bit-strings; avoid all-ones and ensure consistent bit-length across CU/DU/AMF.
