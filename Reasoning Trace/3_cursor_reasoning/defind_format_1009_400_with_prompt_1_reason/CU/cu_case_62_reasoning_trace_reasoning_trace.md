## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The setup is OAI NR SA with RF simulator: CU, DU, and UE all report running in SA mode and the CU command line shows `--rfsim --sa`.
- Expected bring-up: process start → CU parses config → DU parses config → F1AP between DU↔CU (SCTP) → NGAP CU↔AMF (not shown) → DU activates radio → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB/RACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- The provided misconfiguration is **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**. In 3GPP NGAP, the Global gNB ID contains a `gNB-ID` field whose bit length is constrained (commonly 22 bits in TS 38.413/36.413 lineage; OAI typically validates and encodes within an implementation-defined width). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all ones) exceeds typical allowed ranges and may break ID encoding, hashing, or F1/NGAP setup logic.
- High-level symptom pattern in logs:
  - CU: Initializes, parses `GNBSParams`, but no clear F1-C listener/accept sequence appears; also flags an unrelated `nia9` algorithm warning.
  - DU: Fully initializes PHY/MAC, then repeatedly fails SCTP connect to CU (`Connection refused`) and never receives F1 Setup Response → radio not activated.
  - UE: Repeatedly fails to connect to RFsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 (`errno(111) Connection refused`) → DU side server likely not bound/started because DU is waiting for F1 setup.

Assumed network_config highlights (derived from logs and typical OAI defaults):
- gnb_conf: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (misconfigured), F1-C DU↔CU addresses (DU shows `F1-C DU 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5`), band/numerology consistent with 3.6192 GHz, `N_RB_DL=106`, TDD config OK.
- ue_conf: rfsimulator client targeting `127.0.0.1:4043`, frequencies matching DU (3.6192 GHz), numerology `mu=1`.

Initial mismatch: `gNB_ID` clearly out of spec/implementation range, likely blocking CU’s valid identity construction for F1/NGAP and preventing DU association (hence UE cannot connect to RFsim server).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode and build:
  - `[UTIL] running in SA mode` and build hash present.
- RAN context:
  - `[GNB_APP] Initialized RAN Context: ... RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` suggests CU-only (no MAC/L1) — normal for split CU.
- F1 identity:
  - `[GNB_APP] F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU` — internal CU id printed, but we do not see the usual listener bind logs or incoming SCTP association handling in this excerpt.
- Config parsing:
  - Multiple `Reading 'GNBSParams'` lines — CU loads `GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, event params.
- Anomaly:
  - `unknown integrity algorithm "nia9"` — likely benign for F1 bring-up, but should be corrected later.
- What’s missing:
  - No `[SCTP] server listening`/`association established` logs for F1-C on CU side.

Interpretation: If `gNB_ID` is invalid, CU may parse GNBS but later fail to properly construct/encode IDs for F1/NGAP, leading to missing F1-C server readiness or rejection of associations. This aligns with DU seeing `Connection refused`.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes fully through PHY/MAC, sets TDD, frequencies, and SIB1. Nothing fatal appears at PHY/MAC level.
- F1AP client behavior:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` → attempts SCTP connect.
  - Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and `[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3)`.
- App state:
  - `[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` persists.

Interpretation: DU is healthy but blocked because the CU is not accepting SCTP (server not bound or actively rejecting). This is consistent with a CU-side configuration/ID issue rather than DU PHY/MAC misconfig.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE config matches DU RF params: `DL freq 3619200000`, `N_RB_DL 106`, `mu=1`.
- UE acts as RFsim client and repeatedly fails to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111) Connection refused`.

Interpretation: In OAI RFsim, the gNB side typically hosts the server. Since DU never transitions to active (waiting for F1 setup), the RFsim server is not up, so UE cannot connect. This is a downstream effect of the DU↔CU F1 failure.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU parses config but (in this excerpt) no F1-C accept/listen logs appear.
  - DU repeatedly attempts F1-C SCTP to CU and is refused.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim server because DU is not active without F1 Setup.
- Misconfigured parameter focus:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is outside typical allowed ranges (e.g., 22-bit gNB-ID field in NGAP; OAI often enforces narrower masks/encoders). Such an ID can fail ASN.1 encoding, break ID derivations (e.g., cell identity composition), or trigger validation failures that prevent CU from exposing F1-C properly.
- Supporting symptoms:
  - No PHY/MAC errors on DU; failures are purely transport/SCTP-level to CU.
  - CU shows config reads but lacks server accept logs, consistent with an upstream initialization break.

Root cause: The CU’s `gNB_ID` is invalid (`0xFFFFFFFF`), preventing correct F1/NGAP identity handling and causing the CU to refuse DU SCTP connections. Consequently, DU never activates radio and the UE RFsim client sees connection refused.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix the invalid gNB ID to a value within the supported bit width. Conservative, standards-aligned selection keeps the ID within 22 bits for NGAP encoders and OAI expectations.
  - Example valid values: `0x000001`, `0x00321F`, etc.
- Also correct the integrity algorithm warning (`nia9` → `nia1` or `nia2`) to avoid later security negotiation issues, though it’s not the primary blocker here.
- After changes, restart CU first (ensure it binds F1-C), then start DU, then UE.
- Verify:
  - CU should log F1-C listener and incoming SCTP association.
  - DU should log successful F1 Setup and “activating radio”.
  - UE should connect to RFsim server and proceed to SSB detection/PRACH.

Proposed corrected snippets inside `network_config` (JSONC-style with comments):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000001" // CHANGED: from 0xFFFFFFFF to a small valid ID within spec range
      },
      "security": {
        "integrity_algorithm": "nia1" // CHANGED: from unsupported "nia9" to valid algorithm
      },
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_addr": "127.0.0.5",
        "DU_addr": "127.0.0.3"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043
      },
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "numerology": 1,
        "N_RB_DL": 106
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Additional diagnostics if issues persist after the fix:
- Check CU logs for NGAP encoder warnings involving Global gNB ID.
- Ensure no conflicting `gNB_ID` is used by multiple logical nodes in the same deployment (rare in RFsim, but relevant in multi-gNB tests).
- Validate SCTP firewalling or address binding (less likely here given `Connection refused` vs timeout).

---

## 7. Limitations

- The logs are abbreviated and lack timestamps; CU’s F1-C bind/accept stage is not shown — inference is based on DU’s repeated SCTP refusals and the known invalid `gNB_ID` value.
- Full `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` content is not provided; recommended fixes target the clearly erroneous fields and common defaults.
- Bit-width specifics for `gNB_ID` can vary with implementation; the safe guidance is to use a small value that comfortably fits typical NGAP/OAI encoders (≤ 22 bits) to avoid encoding/validation failures.
