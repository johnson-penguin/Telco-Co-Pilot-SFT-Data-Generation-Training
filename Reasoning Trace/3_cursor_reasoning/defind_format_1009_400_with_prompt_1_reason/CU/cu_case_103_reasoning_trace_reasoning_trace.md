## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- **Scenario**: OAI nr-softmodem in SA mode with `--rfsim`. Components: CU, DU, UE. Expected bring-up: process start → configuration parse → DU↔CU F1-C SCTP association → DU activates radio/time source → rfsim server listens → UE connects to rfsim → SSB detect → PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- **Guiding clue (misconfigured_param)**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` in the CU configuration.
- **Immediate expectation**: Extremely large `gNB_ID` likely violates OAI constraints (implementation expects limited-bit gNB ID) and/or triggers parser/validation issues. If CU fails configuration, F1 setup won’t succeed; DU will retry SCTP; UE’s rfsim client won’t find a server.
- **Network config parsing**: Not explicitly provided beyond the misconfigured parameter. From logs:
  - CU invokes: `nr-softmodem --rfsim --sa -O <.../cu_case_103.conf>` then aborts at config parse.
  - DU TDD config shows FR1 n78-like setup: `absFrequencySSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz`, `N_RB 106`, `mu 1`. F1-C intended between `127.0.0.3 (DU)` and `127.0.0.5 (CU)`.
  - UE config aligns with FR1 3.6192 GHz and repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim at `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial mismatch highlights: CU cannot load config (syntax/validation error), DU cannot establish F1 with CU (connection refused), UE cannot connect to rfsim (server not listening). These all cascade from the CU config failure tied to `gNBs.gNB_ID`.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- `[LIBCONFIG] file ... cu_case_103.conf - line 15: syntax error` and subsequent `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded` → the CU configuration failed at parse/validation time.
- `CMDLINE: ... nr-softmodem --rfsim --sa -O .../cu_case_103.conf` confirms SA+rfsim CU role.
- After the parse failure, multiple `config_get ... skipped, config module not properly initialized` and `Getting configuration failed` lines → CU aborts initialization prior to any NGAP/F1 setup.
- This aligns with a malformed or unacceptable parameter value at/near line 15. Given the provided misconfiguration, `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is a prime candidate: even if syntactically a valid hex literal, OAI’s config layer or higher-level validation may reject out-of-range gNB IDs, which can surface as a parse error depending on constraints.
- Consequence: CU never brings up SCTP listener for F1-C and thus will refuse DU’s connection attempts.

Cross-reference expectations:
- F1-C endpoint in DU logs: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`. With CU not initialized, `127.0.0.5` does not accept SCTP, explaining repeated connection refused events at the DU.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU successfully initializes PHY/MAC/RRC parameters for FR1 TDD, including:
  - `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz`, `N_RB 106`, `mu 1`.
  - TDD period index, slot patterning, and antenna config.
  - F1AP client intent: `connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated cycle:
  - `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused`
  - `[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...`
  - `[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`
- Key behavior: DU explicitly waits for F1 Setup Response before activating the radio. In rfsim mode, the server-side RF simulator socket typically starts when the DU activates the radio/time source path. Since F1 never completes, DU stays in a pre-activation state, likely never opening the rfsim server listener.
- No PHY crashes, PRACH errors, or TDD misconfig here; the DU is blocked purely by F1-C being down.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes for FR1 3.6192 GHz, `N_RB 106`, `mu 1`, matching the DU’s intended cell.
- Repeated:
  - `Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side`
  - `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043`
  - `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` (connection refused)
- Interpretation: rfsim server not listening at 127.0.0.1:4043. That server is the DU when operating in rfsim mode. Since DU didn’t activate radio due to missing F1 Setup Response (because CU failed configuration), the UE has nothing to connect to.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU fails immediately at configuration parse (line 15) → does not bring up F1-C.
  - DU continuously retries SCTP to CU’s F1-C (`127.0.0.5`) → connection refused due to CU down.
  - DU therefore never receives F1 Setup Response → does not activate radio or rfsim server.
  - UE repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim server (`127.0.0.1:4043`) → connection refused since DU server never started.
- Root cause anchored on misconfigured parameter:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is outside OAI’s supported range for `gNB_ID`. In 5G system identifiers, the gNB ID used in NG/F1 contexts is a bit-field with constrained width (3GPP references: NR-CGI uses a 36-bit NRCellID, while the gNB ID component length is constrained; OAI implementations commonly constrain `gNB_ID` to ≤ 24 bits in configuration). Setting `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all-ones) can violate these constraints, leading to parser/validation failure.
  - The CU log’s “syntax error” at the config line and immediate config module failure are consistent with an unacceptable value for `gNB_ID` at/near that line.
- Therefore: The misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID` prevented CU startup, which cascaded to DU F1 failure and UE rfsim connection failure.

Note: If external confirmation is needed, consult OAI documentation/examples where `gNB_ID` values are typically modest hex values (e.g., `0xe00`, `0x000001`, etc.), and 3GPP TS 38.413/38.473 define encoding/bit-length constraints for gNB IDs in NG/F1 procedures.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Actionable fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, implementation-supported value within the expected bit width. Conservatively, choose a value ≤ `0x00FFFFFF` (24 bits). Example safe values: `0x000001`, `0x0000E00`, or any organizationally assigned ID within range.

After change, expected recovery path:
- CU parses config successfully → brings up F1-C listener.
- DU connects over SCTP → receives F1 Setup Response → activates radio/time source → starts rfsim server.
- UE’s rfsim client successfully connects → proceeds to SSB detection, PRACH, RRC connection.

Suggested corrected snippets (expressed as JSON-like for clarity; use your config format accordingly):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      // Fixed: limit gNB_ID to ≤ 24 bits
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001" // previously 0xFFFFFFFF; now within supported range
      },
      // Ensure CU F1-C bind/listen is correct (as per your environment)
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_addr": "127.0.0.5",
        "DU_addr": "127.0.0.3"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change required for frequency; kept aligned with DU
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "numerology": 1,
        "n_rb_dl": 106
      },
      // UE connects to local rfsim server provided by DU
      "rfsimulator": {
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Further diagnostic tips if issues persist:
- Validate the actual CU config file syntax around line 15 (trailing commas/semicolons, section braces). Ensure the `gNB_ID` line matches the expected libconfig syntax for your OAI branch.
- Check CU logs for NGAP/AMF configuration warnings after fixing `gNB_ID`.
- On DU, once F1 is up, confirm “activating radio” and that rfsim server binds to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- On UE, observe the first successful TCP connect log and subsequent SSB detection/PRACH.

## 7. Limitations

- CU logs report a “syntax error” but do not print the exact offending line; diagnosis relies on the provided `misconfigured_param` and typical OAI constraints on `gNB_ID`.
- Full `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` JSON objects were not provided; recommendations assume standard OAI SA+rfsim defaults visible in the DU/UE logs.
- Bit-width specifics for `gNB_ID` vary across specs/interfaces; the operational guidance here follows common OAI configuration practices and examples. If your deployment relies on different limits, set `gNB_ID` accordingly but avoid maximal 32-bit all-ones values.
