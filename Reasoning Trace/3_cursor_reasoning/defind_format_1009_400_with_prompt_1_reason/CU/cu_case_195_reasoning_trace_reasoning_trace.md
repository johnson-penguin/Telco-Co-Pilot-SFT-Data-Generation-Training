## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Scenario**: OAI NR SA, using `--rfsim` (software RF simulator) with three components: CU, DU, UE.
- **Expected bring-up flow**: CU validates configuration and starts (listens on F1-C and NGAP) → DU initializes PHY/MAC, starts F1AP and connects to CU over SCTP → upon successful F1 Setup Response, DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE (rfsim client) connects to the server, synchronizes to SSB, performs PRACH, RRC connection and registration/PDU session.
- **Misconfigured parameter (given)**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - In 5G NR, the gNB ID used in NG/RAN signaling is limited to at most 22 bits (e.g., 3GPP TS 38.300, 38.413 schema constraints). Maximum valid is `0x3FFFFF`. `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit) exceeds this, leading to configuration validation failure in OAI.
- **Immediate expectation from the misconfig**: CU performs strict `config_execcheck`. An out-of-range `gNB_ID` forces an early exit before F1/NGAP startup. If CU is down, DU’s SCTP connects to CU are refused. Without CU acceptance and F1 Setup Response, DU will not activate radio nor open the rfsim server. Consequently, the UE, acting as rfsim client, continuously fails to connect.
- **Network configuration facts parsed/inferred from logs**:
  - **gnb_conf**
    - `gNBs.gNB_ID`: set to `0xFFFFFFFF` (invalid, > 22 bits) → fatal at CU.
    - F1-C addressing: DU at `127.0.0.3` connects to CU at `127.0.0.5`.
    - Serving cell parameters: `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280` → `3619200000 Hz`; `N_RB=106`, μ=1; TDD configuration consistent.
    - Additional CU config issues logged: invalid `sst` (`-1`, range 0..255) → also triggers `config_execcheck` error. This is a separate problem but the known root cause we target is the invalid `gNB_ID`.
  - **ue_conf**
    - RF parameters match DU: DL/UL at `3619200000 Hz`, μ=1, `N_RB_DL=106`.
    - rfsim client repeatedly tries `127.0.0.1:4043` but finds no server.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode, prints version, and RAN context creation. It shows SDAP disabled and DRB count 1 (initialization proceeds some steps).
- Configuration validation then flags:
  - `config_check_intrange: sst: -1 invalid value, authorized range: 0 255`, and `config_execcheck` indicates wrong parameter(s) in `plmn_list.snssaiList`.
  - Shortly after, `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` → CU terminates before binding F1-C or NGAP.
- Cross-check with misconfigured `gNB_ID`:
  - OAI validates `gNB_ID` alongside PLMN/S-NSSAI fields. An out-of-range `gNB_ID` (32-bit) independently causes the same fatal `config_execcheck` exit. Even if `sst` is also invalid, the pre-known misconfig `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is sufficient to explain CU shutdown, preventing any F1/NGAP listeners.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU completes PHY/MAC initialization: antenna, TDD, SIB1, frequencies (`3619200000 Hz`), `N_RB=106`, μ=1. It starts F1AP and GTPU; threads are created.
- DU attempts F1-C connect to CU (`127.0.0.5`) from DU IP `127.0.0.3`.
- Repeated failures: `[SCTP]   Connect failed: Connection refused` with F1AP retries.
- DU explicitly logs: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → DU remains in pre-activation state, thus rfsim server is not started.
- Causality: CU is not running due to config_execcheck abort (rooted in invalid `gNB_ID`), so the DU cannot complete F1 setup.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY and RF at `3619200000 Hz`, μ=1, `N_RB_DL=106`.
- UE acts as rfsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, failing with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- Reason: DU did not activate radio nor start rfsim server because it never received F1 Setup Response from the CU.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU exits early during `config_execcheck` (no F1/NGAP servers) → DU’s SCTP attempts are refused.
  - DU remains waiting for F1 Setup Response, so radio/rfsim are not activated.
  - UE fails to connect to rfsim server (not up) and loops with connection refused.
- Guided by the misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`:
  - gNB ID valid range is ≤ 22 bits. `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds spec/implementation constraints; OAI config validation fails and terminates the CU.
  - While CU logs also show invalid `sst`, the known misconfig alone fully explains the observed system-wide failure: CU down → DU blocked → UE cannot connect.
- Root cause: **Out-of-range `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` in CU configuration violates 3GPP/OAI constraints, causing CU `config_execcheck` to abort.** This prevents F1 setup, DU activation, and rfsim server availability, leading to UE connection failures.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Primary fix: Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid ≤22-bit value (e.g., `0x000001` up to `0x3FFFFF`). Use consistent IDs across CU/DU as required by your deployment.
- Secondary fixes (recommended but not the primary root cause): Correct PLMN/S-NSSAI fields; set `sst` to a valid value (0..255) and ensure `mcc/mnc/mnc_length` are valid.
- Post-fix verification checklist:
  - CU starts without `config_execcheck` errors, binds F1-C/NGAP, and connects to AMF if configured.
  - DU establishes F1 SCTP association, receives F1 Setup Response, and logs radio activation; rfsim server listens.
  - UE connects to rfsim server, detects SSB, proceeds with PRACH and RRC procedures.
- Troubleshooting if issues persist:
  - Increase CONFIG/F1AP log levels on CU.
  - Confirm loopback alias routing: DU `127.0.0.3` can reach CU `127.0.0.5`.
  - Ensure DU-side identifiers (e.g., `gNB_DU_id`) are within OAI-expected ranges and do not conflict.

- Corrected configuration snippets (illustrative), using JSON with comments for clarity:

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not explicitly print the `gNB_ID` range error; however, CU’s `config_execcheck` exit combined with the known misconfigured parameter is sufficient to conclude the root cause.
- Additional invalid fields (e.g., `sst`) are present and would also cause CU abort; the requested diagnosis centers on `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, which is independently fatal.
- PHY/TDD settings appear consistent; failure occurs prior to radio activation due to control-plane bring-up being blocked at F1 by the CU’s early termination.
