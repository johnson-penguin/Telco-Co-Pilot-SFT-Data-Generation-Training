## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs clearly indicate OpenAirInterface (OAI) NR SA mode with RF simulator: CU/DU show “running in SA mode” and the CU command line contains `--rfsim --sa`.
- Expected flow: initialization → NGAP setup (CU↔AMF) → F1 setup (CU↔DU, SCTP) → DU radio activation → UE connects over rfsim → PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**.
- Key log landmarks:
  - CU: NGSetupRequest/Response succeeds; then F1 starts but CU crashes when creating SCTP listener and GTP-U instance; CU tries to use an invalid IP `999.999.999.999` and asserts.
  - DU: initializes PHY/MAC/RRC, starts F1 (client); repeatedly retries SCTP to CU with “Connection refused” (CU side not accepting/has crashed), so DU waits for F1 Setup Response and never activates radio.
  - UE: repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server `127.0.0.1:4043` (connection refused) because the gNB rfsim server never comes up (CU/DU didn’t complete F1/radio activation).

Assumptions and external knowledge applied:
- In 5G, NGAP `gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING of length 22..32 bits (3GPP TS 38.413/38.413 Annex and signaled via NGSetup). OAI historically also uses a “macro gNB id” concept (akin to LTE macro eNB 20-bit) for some internal indexing and logging.
- While 32-bit values are allowed by the spec, all-ones `0xFFFFFFFF` is an edge case; if length handling or masking is inconsistent between subsystems (NGAP/F1AP/RRC), OAI may truncate/mask bits differently, yielding inconsistent IDs across components.
- From `network_config` (as provided in the JSON description): we key off `gnb_conf.gNB_ID = 0xFFFFFFFF`. Other exact fields are not enumerated, but CU logs show clearly wrong `F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ` destination address `999.999.999.999`, which indicates broken config parsing/derivation in the CU’s NET/F1 sections at runtime.

Initial mismatch signals:
- CU logs “Registered new gNB and macro gNB id 3584” (decimal), which is inconsistent with `0xFFFFFFFF`. This suggests masking/truncation produced a much smaller “macro” ID (e.g., `0xE00 = 3584)`, implying non-uniform ID handling.
- DU logs show `gNB_DU_id 3584` as well, but F1 connection still fails because CU cannot bring up SCTP (CU-side crash). The UE connection refusals are a downstream symptom.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Initialization is nominal: SA mode, NGAP and GTP threads, RRC task, CU-UP acceptance, then NGSetupRequest is sent and NGSetupResponse received — NGAP path is up.
- Critical section as F1 starts:
  - `F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 999.999.999.999` immediately followed by `getaddrinfo() failed: Name or service not known` and assertion at `sctp_eNB_task.c:617`.
  - GTP-U initialization also attempts `999.999.999.999` and fails, then `gtpu instance id: -1`, then assertion in `F1AP_CU_task()` complaining “Failed to create CU F1-U UDP listener.” CU exits.
- Cross-reference with config reading lines: many repeated “Reading 'GNBSParams' / 'SCTPParams' / 'NETParams'...” then the invalid address appears. This pattern is typical when a broken/edge config value cascades into partially initialized structures, leaving defaults or sentinel strings that are invalid (like `999.999.999.999`).
- CU also prints `macro gNB id 3584` despite the misconfigured `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. That divergence suggests OAI masked/truncated the configured ID into a shorter macro ID for NGAP, whereas other subsystems may still reference the original full-width value or depend on consistent derived keys.

Relevance to `gNB_ID`:
- Although the immediate crash is on an invalid IP, the inconsistent derivation/handling of the `gNB_ID` can desynchronize internal configuration paths, especially where IDs index into per-instance or per-cell configurations (NGAP vs F1 vs NET). An all-ones value is a known footgun for mask/length handling.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC, sets TDD config, calculates frequencies and numerology correctly, and starts F1 (client side):
  - “F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 127.0.0.3”.
  - Repeated: “SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused” followed by F1AP retry loop; DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
- No PHY/MAC assert; the DU is healthy but cannot complete F1 because CU-side listener never came up (CU crashed during SCTP/UDP listener creation as above).
- DU logs also show `gNB_DU_id 3584`, matching CU’s printed macro id, reinforcing that at least parts of the stack are operating with a truncated/masked ID, not the configured `0xFFFFFFFF`.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY and hardware emulation, then tries to connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly with `errno(111) Connection refused`.
- This is expected because the gNB’s rfsim server side is brought up only once CU/DU coordination progresses far enough; with CU crashed and DU stuck waiting for F1, no rfsim endpoint accepts connections.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Correlation timeline:
- CU reaches NGAP success but crashes while starting F1 due to invalid address and GTP-U listener creation failure; DU sees connection refused; UE sees rfsim refused.
- The common driver is configuration inconsistency. The misconfigured parameter is **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**.

Why `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is problematic in OAI practice:
- 3GPP allows 22..32-bit `gNB-ID` lengths; however, OAI code paths historically derive a “macro gNB id” and also build instance keys and section lookups from the configured ID. An all-ones value at the maximum width is a classic stress case for bit-length handling, masking, and string/section derivations.
- Evidence of inconsistent handling: CU prints macro id 3584 (0xE00), not `0xFFFFFFFF`; DU also shows 3584. This indicates non-uniform bit-length/mask usage across subsystems. When identity-derived keys are inconsistent, subsequent section reads (e.g., NET/F1 target addresses) can fall back to placeholders or parse the wrong stanza, surfacing as the bogus `999.999.999.999` address and subsequent asserts.
- Therefore, the root cause is the invalid/extreme `gNB_ID` that triggers identity derivation inconsistency, which leads CU to mis-resolve F1/NET addresses and fail to start listeners. The downstream failures (DU SCTP refused, UE rfsim refused) follow from the CU crash.

External spec check (sanity):
- NGAP permits up to 32 bits, but implementations must consistently agree on the configured bit length and mapping across NGAP/F1/RRC and internal indexing. OAI’s observed truncation to 3584 strongly suggests the configured `0xFFFFFFFF` isn’t honored uniformly, validating this as the driving misconfiguration.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a sane, non-extreme value that matches the intended bit length for your deployment and is consistently used across CU and DU (e.g., a 22–28-bit value), and ensure DU uses the same ID convention.
- Verify and correct CU `F1AP`/`NET` address parameters. After fixing `gNB_ID`, the correct `F1-C` peer and local addresses should resolve (avoid placeholders like `999.999.999.999`). Align CU and DU F1-C IP/ports.

Suggested corrected network_config snippet (JSON-with-comments to highlight changes):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000E00" // Changed: avoid all-ones; 0xE00 == 3584 matches logs
      },
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_F1C_bind_addr": "127.0.0.5", // Ensure a valid local bind address
        "DU_F1C_remote_addr": "127.0.0.3", // Match DU log expectation
        "F1C_port": 38472
      },
      "NET": {
        "GTPU_local_addr": "127.0.0.5", // Replace invalid 999.999.999.999
        "GTPU_port": 2152
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", // UE connects to local rfsim once gNB is up
      "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
      "frequency_dl_hz": 3619200000,
      "numerology_mu": 1,
      "n_rb_dl": 106
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Apply the `gNB_ID` change on both CU and DU configs. Re-run CU first; confirm NGSetup completes and CU starts F1 listeners without assertions.
- Start DU; confirm F1 SCTP association succeeds and DU activates radio.
- Start UE; it should connect to rfsim (no more connection refused), proceed with PRACH/RRC attach.

Further validation:
- If needed, explicitly set the `gNB-ID` bit length in NGAP configuration (some builds allow setting the length) to ensure CU/DU agree.
- Audit logs for any residual masking messages; ensure the printed macro id equals the configured intent.


## 7. Limitations

- The provided JSON does not include the full `network_config` object; address fields were inferred from logs. The example fix shows sane defaults; adapt to your topology.
- Logs are truncated; exact code paths mapping `gNB_ID` into macro id and F1/NET keys are inferred from OAI behavior and the observed 3584 value.
- While 32-bit `gNB-ID` is spec-compliant, the all-ones edge value triggered inconsistent handling in this OAI setup; choosing a modest, explicit value avoids this pitfall.
