## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs show OAI `nr-softmodem` in SA mode with RF simulator (`--rfsim --sa`). CU is pure-CU (no L1/RU), DU is full L1/MAC/RLC, UE is rfsim client.
- Expected flow: CU and DU start → CU exposes F1-C SCTP server → DU connects F1-C to CU, exchanges F1 Setup → DU activates radio → UE connects to rfsim server (gNB side) on port 4043 → SSB/PRACH → RRC → NAS/NGAP to AMF → PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - In NR, `nrCellIdentity` is 36 bits; gNB-ID length is chosen (22..32 bits) and combined with cell ID bits (TS 38.331/38.413/38.463). Using all-ones 32-bit value commonly violates the configured length and/or uniqueness assumptions. In OAI, this value also feeds CU/DU/F1/NG identifiers and may be masked, overflow, or collide internally, breaking F1/NG setup.
- Quick network parameter extraction from logs:
  - DL/UL frequency 3619200000 Hz (N78), `mu=1`, `N_RB=106`, TDD period index 6, SSB freq 641280 (3.6192 GHz). UE matches same frequencies.
  - DU waits for F1 Setup Response before radio activation.
- Initial mismatch clues:
  - DU F1-C repeatedly gets SCTP connection refused to CU at `127.0.0.5` → CU’s F1 server not listening/initialized.
  - UE repeatedly gets `connect() ... :4043 failed, errno(111)` → rfsim server not up (gNB side inactive until DU radio/F1 is active).
  - CU log shows only early-stage config parsing and an RRC warning about ciphering algorithm; no evidence F1C bound.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU starts in SA rfsim, parses config sections, prints:
  - `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
  - RRC warning: `unknown ciphering algorithm "0"` (non-blocking in many OAI builds; would fall back). No explicit F1C bind lines present.
- Notable absence: No SCTP server bind/listen for F1-C on `127.0.0.5` (DU attempts to connect and gets refused), no NGAP/AMF connect logs.
- Plausible impact of `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` on CU:
  - ID overflow/mask can produce invalid or out-of-range CU/DU identifiers for F1AP/NGAP structures (e.g., CU-CP ID, gNB ID part of NG-RAN Node ID), causing initialization to abort F1C server setup.
  - Even if CU prints a derived `gNB_CU_id=3584`, the underlying gNB_ID may still fail internal validations that precede socket creation.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC and system bandwidth; confirms TDD config and SSB frequency.
- Attempts F1AP:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` → peer not listening.
  - `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → DU withholds radio and rfsim server until F1 established.
- No crashes/asserts; this is a systemic dependency failure: DU is healthy but blocked on CU’s F1C.
- This aligns with CU failing to bring up F1C, consistent with invalid `gNB_ID` affecting ID derivations.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes with matching RF numerology and frequencies.
- As rfsim client, it repeatedly tries `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` connection refused.
- This is expected because the DU delays rfsim server activation until F1 Setup completes. Since CU’s F1C is not up, DU never activates, so UE can’t connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline:
  - CU parses config but never exposes F1C; DU’s SCTP to CU is refused.
  - DU therefore never transitions to active radio; UE cannot connect to rfsim port 4043.
- Root cause guided by misconfiguration:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid for typical 22–32 bit gNB-ID choices and can conflict with cell identity composition and OAI’s internal ID handling (F1AP/NGAP). This prevents proper CU identity setup and F1C initialization, cascading to DU F1 failures and UE rfsim failures.
- Supporting standards knowledge:
  - TS 38.331 defines `nrCellIdentity` (36 bits) and gNB-ID length selection; TS 38.413/38.463 carry node IDs in NGAP/F1AP. Using all-ones 32-bit without respecting the configured bit-length is non-compliant and prone to rejection.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix:
  - Choose a valid, unique `gNB_ID` that respects the configured gNB-ID bit length (commonly 22 bits in many deployments) and does not overflow when combined into `nrCellIdentity`.
  - Practical safe picks: small integers (e.g., `0x00000001` or `0x00000E00`) consistently used by CU and DU config blocks.
  - Also correct the CU security ciphering value from `"0"` to a valid algorithm (e.g., `nea1`/`nea2`) to avoid future RRC warnings.
- After change, validate sequence:
  1) CU logs should show F1C SCTP server listening; 2) DU connects, F1 Setup completes; 3) DU activates radio and rfsim server; 4) UE connects to 4043; 5) SSB/PRACH/RRC proceed.
- Corrected snippets (illustrative structure within your `network_config`). Comments explain changes.

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      // Change: valid, small, unique ID within gNB-ID bit-length
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000001", // was 0xFFFFFFFF → invalid/all-ones
        "gnb_name": "gNB-Eurecom",
        // Ensure CU/DU share consistent PLMN and TAC; shown for context

    }
  }
}
```

- Further checks if issues persist:
  - Confirm CU binds SCTP on `127.0.0.5:F1C_PORT` (netstat/ss) and DU can reach it (no local firewall in rfsim).
  - Verify any `gNB_ID` masks/length settings in your config (some OAI knobs control gNB-ID bit length). Keep ID within the selected length.
  - Align PLMN/TAC across CU/DU and ensure AMF reachability if proceeding to NGAP.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated; CU logs lack explicit errors explaining why F1C is not listening. Diagnosis relies on the provided misconfigured parameter and the consistent refusal pattern seen by DU/UE.
- Exact gNB-ID bit-length used by your build/config is not shown; recommendation uses conservative small ID safe across 22–32 bit choices.
- No full `network_config` JSON was provided; snippets above illustrate the minimum to correct the root cause and remove the CU RRC warning.
