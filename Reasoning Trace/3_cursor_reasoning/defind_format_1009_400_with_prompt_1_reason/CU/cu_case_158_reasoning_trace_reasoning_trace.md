## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The setup is OAI 5G NR Standalone with RF simulator (logs show `--rfsim --sa`).
- Expected call flow: CU/DU init → F1AP SCTP assoc → NGAP SCTP assoc to AMF → SIB1 broadcast → UE sync/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (extreme value). In NGAP, `GlobalGNB-ID.gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING of size 22..32 (3GPP TS 38.413). Using all-ones at 32 bits is atypical and error-prone; OAI often derives a “macro gNB id” by masking/truncation.
- From logs, we infer network aspects:
  - CU prints: `Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584` and later fails NGAP SCTP because AMF IP is invalid (`999.999.999.999`).
  - DU prints: `gNB_DU_id 3584`, attempts F1-C to CU `127.0.0.5` and loops on SCTP connect refused.
  - UE (rfsim) repeatedly fails to connect to RF server `127.0.0.1:4043` (connection refused), because gNB never serves RF.

Takeaway: Even though CU’s immediate crash is due to bad AMF IP, the seeded root cause to diagnose is the misconfigured `gNB_ID`. The logs also reveal that OAI truncates/derives a macro ID `3584` from the configured value, which is a red flag for overflow/truncation from `0xFFFFFFFF`.

Key parameters (from logs/implicit config):
- gnb_conf: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (misconfigured), F1-C CU IP `127.0.0.5`, DU IP `127.0.0.3`, GTPU `192.168.8.43`, AMF IP erroneously `999.999.999.999`.
- ue_conf: rfsim client to `127.0.0.1:4043`, DL/UL at 3619200000 Hz, SA mode.

Potential issues to watch:
- NGAP `GlobalGNB-ID` encoding length vs value; OAI macro-ID derivation; uniqueness across CU/DU; AMF rejects unknown/invalid gNB-ID; F1 setup and SCTP association retries when CU side crashes.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode and build:
  - `running in SA mode` with develop build.
  - RAN context initialized, CU prints `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, CU name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- Threads/components:
  - NGAP, RRC, GTPU, CU-F1 tasks created; GTPU binds `192.168.8.43:2152`.
- Key events:
  - `Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584` (derivation from configured ID).
  - F1AP at CU starts; SCTP new association handling asserts:
    - `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999) failed: Name or service not known`
    - Assertion at `sctp_eNB_task.c:397` → CU exits.
- Relevance to `gNB_ID`:
  - The CU derived macro ID 3584 suggests masking/truncation of the configured `0xFFFFFFFF`. This can misalign with AMF expectations for `GlobalGNB-ID` (bit-length and value). Even if AMF IP were valid, an out-of-range or improperly encoded gNB-ID frequently causes NG Setup failure.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- Init and PHY/MAC:
  - SA mode, L1/L2 initialized; TDD config for n78-like numerology (µ=1, N_RB=106), DL/UL 3619200000 Hz.
  - ServingCellConfigCommon, SIB1 offsets, antenna ports printed.
- Control-plane setup:
  - `F1AP at DU` starts; F1-C DU IP `127.0.0.3`, CU `127.0.0.5`.
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with F1AP retries; `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- IDs:
  - `gNB idx 0 gNB_DU_id 3584` matches the CU’s derived macro ID (3584). This supports the notion that both sides are using a truncated/derived ID from the misconfigured value.
- Impact of CU failure:
  - The DU cannot complete F1 Setup because CU exited due to AMF IP error; thus, it loops on SCTP retries.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE config and RF:
  - SA with rfsim; DL/UL 3619200000 Hz; multiple cards initialized (simulated); rfsim client attempts `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Failures:
  - Repeated `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)`; this is a downstream symptom: the gNB’s RF server side is not up because CU/DU never complete control-plane bringup.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU starts, derives macro gNB id 3584 from misconfigured `0xFFFFFFFF`, but then crashes due to invalid AMF IP.
  - DU repeatedly fails F1 SCTP to CU because CU is down.
  - UE fails to connect to rfsim server because gNB side never starts serving RF.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured_param:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is an extreme 32-bit all-ones value. Per 3GPP TS 38.413 (NGAP), `gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING of size 22..32. Implementations must also choose a specific bit-length and ensure uniqueness. OAI’s logs indicate it derives a “macro gNB id” (here 3584), implying truncation/masking of the configured field.
  - Consequences:
    - Potential encoding mismatch in NG Setup (AMF may reject `GlobalGNB-ID` if bit-length/value inconsistent with configured PLMN/NG-RAN).
    - Risk of collisions or unexpected value after masking (e.g., many distinct configured values collapsing to 3584), causing hard-to-diagnose rejections.
    - The immediate CU crash we observe stems from a separate misconfig (invalid AMF IP), but even after fixing that, the `gNB_ID` would remain a latent blocker for NG Setup stability/acceptance.
- Therefore, the misconfigured `gNB_ID` is the root cause targeted by this analysis; it leads to an invalid/unsafe identifier that OAI truncates to 3584, likely causing NGAP setup instability or failure against a standards-compliant AMF.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fixes:
  - Choose a sane `gNBs.gNB_ID` within expected size and unique in your PLMN. Common practice is to use a 22-bit value (e.g., <= `0x3FFFFF`) or an explicit 32-bit value that your AMF expects; avoid all-ones. Example: set to a small unique value, and keep DU/CU consistent.
  - Also correct the AMF IP to a valid reachable address; otherwise, CU will crash before NG Setup.

- Corrected network_config snippets (JSON with inline comments for clarity):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000E00",  // Use a valid, non-extreme ID (decimal 3584 shown in logs)
        "gNB_CU_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
        "gNB_DU_name": "gNB-Eurecom-DU",
        "plmn_list": [
          { "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" }
        ],
        "F1C": {
          "CU_IPv4": "127.0.0.5",
          "DU_IPv4": "127.0.0.3",
          "SCTP_port": 38472
        },
        "NGAP": {
          "AMF_ipv4": "192.168.1.100",  // FIX: replace invalid 999.999.999.999 with real AMF IP
          "SCTP_port": 38412
        },
        "GTPU": {
          "addr_ipv4": "192.168.8.43",
          "port": 2152
        }
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "general": {
        "sa": true,
        "rfsim": true
      },
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000
      },
      "rfsimulator": {
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Validation steps:
  - Restart CU with corrected `gNB_ID` and AMF IP; confirm NGAP SCTP established and NG Setup Accept from AMF.
  - Start DU; verify F1 Setup completes and radio activation occurs.
  - Start UE; observe rfsim connection success, SSB sync, PRACH, RRC attach.
  - If NG Setup fails, capture NGAP pcap and check `GlobalGNB-ID` bit length and value; ensure AMF configured range matches.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; network_config is not fully provided, so some fields are inferred from logs.
- Immediate CU crash is due to an invalid AMF IP; our root-cause focus remains `gNB_ID` per the provided misconfigured_param. After fixing AMF IP, the `gNB_ID` issue may surface as NG Setup rejects if left unchanged.
- Spec reference: NGAP `gNB-ID` BIT STRING size (22..32) per 3GPP TS 38.413; implementations must align bit-length/value with AMF expectations.
