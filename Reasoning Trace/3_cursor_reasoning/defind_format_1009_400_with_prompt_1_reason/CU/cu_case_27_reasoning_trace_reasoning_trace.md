## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs indicate OAI NR SA mode with RF simulator (UE shows rfsim client trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043; DU shows normal PHY/MAC init but postpones radio activation awaiting F1 Setup Response). Expected flow: CU loads config → passes exec checks → starts NGAP and F1-C server; DU initializes PHY/MAC → connects to CU via F1-C (SCTP) → upon F1 Setup Response, DU activates radio and starts RF simulator server → UE connects to RF simulator server → performs cell search/SSB sync → PRACH/RACH → RRC connection → PDU session.

The provided misconfigured parameter is: gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF. In 5G, the gNB-ID is an NG-RAN gNodeB identifier, typically up to 32 bits with a configured bit length (commonly 22 bits in many deployments). Setting gNB_ID to 0xFFFFFFFF (all ones, 32 bits) violates expected ranges/bit-length and triggers OAI configuration checks to fail and abort the CU startup.

Network config extracted (not fully shown here) likely contains:
- gNB: gNB_ID excessively large (0xFFFFFFFF), potentially missing or mismatched `gNB_ID_bit_length`.
- TAC also appears mis-set (CU log flags tracking_area_code 9999999 as out of range), but the fatal exit is due to exec check failures in `gNBs.[0]` which are consistent with the invalid gNB_ID.
- DU and UE frequencies and numerology are consistent (DL 3619200000 Hz, N_RB_DL 106, μ=1), so RF side is aligned.

Initial mismatches:
- CU: config_execcheck aborts; CU never brings up F1-C listener → DU cannot complete F1 association → UE cannot reach RF sim server.
- Misconfigured gNB_ID explains CU abort; TAC is also invalid but secondary.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode: SA; build info present; RAN context initialized with no MAC/L1/RU (CU split only):
  - "Initialized RAN Context: RC.nb_nr_inst = 1, RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0, RC.nb_RU = 0".
- Config validation:
  - "config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 9999999 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533" (TAC invalid).
  - "[CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value".
  - Exits via `config_execcheck()` → "Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun".
- Consequence: CU does not start NGAP or F1-C. Any DU attempts to connect F1-C will be refused (SCTP connection refused). No RF sim server side initialized either on the CU side (in this split, DU hosts RF sim, but radio activation is gated by F1 Setup Response from CU).

Cross-reference with config:
- The misconfigured_param (gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF) is consistent with CU exec check failure. Even if TAC were corrected, CU would still fail due to invalid gNB_ID.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC successfully: antenna ports, TDD pattern (μ=1, 5 ms period), BW 106 PRBs, DL/UL freqs 3619200000 Hz; SIB1 parameters parsed; F1AP initialized with DU IP 127.0.0.3 targeting CU 127.0.0.5.
- Critical sequence:
  - Starts F1AP; attempts SCTP to CU: "Connect failed: Connection refused" repeatedly, interleaved with "Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3), retrying...".
  - "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" — DU does not activate radio or RF sim server until the CU answers F1 Setup. So even though PHY is configured, the actual radio activation is blocked.
- No PHY/MAC errors (no PRACH config issues here). The sole blocker is CU not listening on F1-C because it aborted due to config exec check failures.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes in SA mode; RF parameters match DU (DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, N_RB_DL 106, μ=1).
- RF simulator client behavior:
  - "Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side"; attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly with errno(111) (connection refused).
- Root reason for refusal: DU has not activated radio yet because it is waiting for F1 Setup Response from CU; thus the RF sim server is not up. This cascades from the CU configuration failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU aborts at config validation due to `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (and also TAC invalid). Therefore, CU never starts F1-C.
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU F1-C → remains in pre-activation state → RF sim server is not started.
  - UE, acting as RF sim client, cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 → no RF link → no SSB sync/PRACH.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured_param:
  - gNB_ID must comply with OAI and 3GPP constraints. In NGAP, gNB-ID is encoded with a configured bit length; values must fit the declared length. Using 0xFFFFFFFF (full 32-bit all-ones) either violates configured bit-length (commonly 22) or reserved value checks, triggering `config_execcheck` and aborting.
  - Secondary issue: TAC 9999999 is out-of-range (1..65533) and would also need correction, but the decisive failure shown is the exec check on `gNBs.[0]`, consistent with the invalid gNB_ID.

Therefore, the primary root cause is the invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` causing CU config validation failure and process exit. This cascades to DU F1-C connection refusals and UE RF sim connection refusals.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration corrections (minimum set):
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value that fits the configured bit length (e.g., a small positive value like 1). If the config uses a separate `gNB_ID_bit_length`, ensure the value fits (e.g., ≤ 2^22 − 1 for 22 bits). Avoid all-ones sentinel values.
- Fix TAC to be within 1..65533 and consistent across CU and DU.
- Ensure CU IP/DU IP match your topology (here DU expects CU at 127.0.0.5; keep or adjust consistently).

Proposed corrected snippets (as JSON objects within `network_config`), with comments explaining changes:

```json
{
  "gnb_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "gNB_ID": 1,                       // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a valid small ID
        "gNB_ID_bit_length": 22,           // ensure bit length matches deployment; 22 is common
        "tracking_area_code": 1,           // changed from 9999999 to valid range [1..65533]
        "F1C": { "CU_IPv4": "127.0.0.5", "DU_IPv4": "127.0.0.3" },
        "amf_ip_addr": "127.0.0.18",     // example; ensure correct in your environment
        "plmn_mcc": 1,
        "plmn_mnc": 1,
        "plmn_mnc_len": 2
        // ... other unchanged parameters (freq, TDD pattern, SIB config) remain consistent
      }
    ]
  },
  "ue_conf": {
    "rfsimulator": {
      "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
      "server_port": 4043
    },
    "frequency": 3619200000,
    "n_rb_dl": 106,
    "ssb_subcarrier_spacing": 30
    // No change required on UE side; RF sim failures were due to DU not activating
  }
}
```

Operational steps after applying config fixes:
- Restart CU first; verify no config_execcheck errors; confirm F1-C listening.
- Start DU; confirm F1 Setup completes and DU logs "activating radio"; RF sim server should start.
- Start UE; it should connect to RF sim server, proceed to SSB sync, RACH, and RRC.

Further diagnostics if issues persist:
- Enable higher verbosity for CONFIG and NGAP on CU to confirm gNB-ID encoding.
- Confirm `gNB_ID_bit_length` presence/expectation in your OAI version; if omitted, ensure gNB_ID fits defaults.
- Verify SCTP reachability between DU (127.0.0.3) and CU (127.0.0.5) if IPs are changed from loopback.

## 7. Limitations
- Provided JSON lacks the full `network_config` dump; corrections above assume typical OAI fields and defaults.
- Logs are truncated; exact CU check failing line only states one wrong parameter in `gNBs.[0]`. We attribute this to the misconfigured gNB_ID as guided by the provided `misconfigured_param`; TAC is also invalid but considered secondary.
- Specification references: 3GPP 38.413 (NGAP) defines gNB-ID encoding with configurable bit length. OAI’s `config_execcheck` enforces valid ranges/encodings; exact constraints can vary slightly with OAI branch.
