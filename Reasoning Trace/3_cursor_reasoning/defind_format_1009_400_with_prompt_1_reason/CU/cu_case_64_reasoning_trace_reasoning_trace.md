## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR SA with `--rfsim` based on DU and UE logs: both configure TDD at 3.6192 GHz (band 48) with μ=1 and N_RB_DL=106. Expected flow: components initialize → DU starts PHY/MAC and F1C connects to CU → CU accepts F1 Setup → DU exposes rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim → SSB search/PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session. Potential issues: identity/config mismatches (PLMN, gNB IDs), invalid parameter ranges, or early failures preventing rfsim from listening.

Input’s misconfigured parameter is: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In 3GPP 38.413/38.473 the gNB-ID is a bit string with implementation-chosen length, commonly 22 bits in practice. OAI typically expects `gNB_ID` constrained by `gNB_id_bits` (default ~22). A value of `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits all ones) exceeds a 22-bit mask and is thus invalid; OAI may mask or clamp it, leading to inconsistent identity across CU/DU and downstream signaling problems.

Network configuration (from logs):
- CU: registers “home gNB id 0” and later shows F1 Setup then immediate SCTP shutdown.
- DU: advertises `gNB_DU_id 3584` and proceeds to PHY configuration before F1 Setup Failure is reported.
- PLMN mismatch is also present (CU shows 000/0, DU shows 001/01), which by itself would cause F1 Setup Failure; however, we diagnose primarily with the given misconfigured parameter (gNB_ID).

Initial mismatch notes:
- gNB IDs: CU side effectively ends up with 0 (likely after masking/overflow) while DU uses 3584 → identity divergence.
- PLMN: CU (000/0) vs DU (001/01) → independent mismatch that can trigger F1 failure.

These mismatches explain CU rejecting DU’s F1 setup and the UE failing to connect to the rfsim server (DU likely tears down or never binds after control-plane failure).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Confirms SA mode, threads spawned, GTP-U configured on 192.168.8.43, then F1 threads created.
- "Registered new gNB[0] and home gNB id 0" suggests the configured `gNB_ID` was invalid and normalized to 0 (unexpected for a real deployment).
- CU receives F1 Setup Request from DU id 3584; immediately logs PLMN mismatch: “CU 000.0, DU 00101”. SCTP shutdown follows and CU removes the endpoint. It then states “no DU connected… F1 Setup Failed?”.
- Cross-reference: A valid CU `gNB_ID` should be a stable non-zero value within the configured bit-length; an invalid/overflowed ID can affect internal identity handling and may surface as inconsistent signaling (though here the PLMN mismatch is the explicit failure reason).

Conclusion for CU: CU is operational but rejects DU due to configuration mismatches. The observed “home gNB id 0” is a red flag consistent with the invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` in the provided misconfiguration.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC properly: SSB at 641280 (3.6192 GHz), band 48, μ=1, N_RB 106, TDD pattern, antenna ports, timers, etc. It reports `gNB_DU_id 3584` and starts F1AP towards CU 127.0.0.5.
- DU then reports: “the CU reported F1AP Setup Failure, is there a configuration mismatch?” which aligns with the CU’s PLMN mismatch message and likely also with identity inconsistencies.
- No PHY asserts or PRACH problems are shown; the failure is at the F1 control plane during setup.

Conclusion for DU: Functional at PHY/MAC level, but blocked by F1 Setup Failure caused by configuration mismatches with CU (PLMN and, guided by misconfigured parameter, gNB ID inconsistency).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config matches 3.6192 GHz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106, duplex TDD.
- UE repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim server on 127.0.0.1:4043 and gets ECONNREFUSED (111). This indicates the DU’s rfsim server is not listening (often because DU does not progress to a ready state when F1 setup fails or the process is aborted).

Conclusion for UE: It cannot connect because the DU did not expose the rfsim endpoint due to upstream control-plane failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: DU initializes → F1 setup attempt → CU rejects due to mismatches → DU logs F1 Setup Failure → UE cannot connect to rfsim server.
- The given misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is out-of-range for typical OAI expectations (commonly 22-bit). Such an invalid ID can:
  - Be masked to 0 (as observed in CU: “home gNB id 0”), breaking identity consistency.
  - Cause mismatches between CU and DU gNB identities if only one side masks differently or uses a different bit-length, making F1/NGAP procedures fragile.
- Although logs explicitly show a PLMN mismatch as the immediate failure trigger, the guided diagnosis emphasizes the `gNB_ID` misconfiguration as a primary source of identity inconsistency and unstable behavior. In practice, both must be corrected: set a valid `gNB_ID` within the chosen bit-length and align PLMNs across CU/DU.

Root cause hypothesis:
- Using `0xFFFFFFFF` for `gNBs.gNB_ID` violates the allowed bit-length (e.g., 22 bits). CU normalizes this to 0, leading to gNB identity inconsistency versus DU (3584). Combined with a PLMN mismatch, CU rejects F1 Setup, preventing DU from serving rfsim to the UE.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration changes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a value that fits within `gNB_id_bits` (e.g., 22). Use the same value across CU and DU to avoid identity mismatches (e.g., 3584 to match DU’s observed id). Also explicitly set `gNB_id_bits` to 22 (or your target) on both sides to eliminate ambiguity.
- Align PLMN (MCC/MNC) between CU and DU to resolve the explicit PLMN mismatch observed.

Example corrected snippets (illustrative; keep overall structure identical to your deployment):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": 3584, // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a 22-bit-safe value matching DU
        "gNB_id_bits": 22, // make bit-length explicit and consistent
        "mcc": 1, // align with DU
        "mnc": 1, // align with DU
        "mnc_length": 2 // ensure same MNC length as DU (logs show 00101; use a consistent pair)
      }
      // ... other existing gNB parameters unchanged ...
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No UE-side changes required for gNB_ID; keep RF and SIM params as is
      // Ensure rfsimulator_serveraddr remains 127.0.0.1 if DU runs locally
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks and tools:
- Verify both CU and DU print the same gNB id (e.g., 3584) on startup.
- Ensure CU and DU PLMN fields match (MCC/MNC/MNC length). The CU should no longer report PLMN mismatch; F1 Setup should succeed.
- Confirm DU binds the rfsim server port (4043 by default) and the UE can connect.
- If issues persist, increase F1AP and NGAP log verbosity and check for identity encoding warnings.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial and do not include explicit config file dumps; conclusions infer from observed printouts and the provided misconfigured parameter.
- The failure path shows a PLMN mismatch explicitly; we attribute the core identity instability to `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` per the task guidance, but both issues must be fixed to restore service.
- Spec reference: gNB-ID is a bit string; typical deployments use ~22 bits. Using a full 32-bit all-ones value is not portable and will be masked/clamped by implementations, causing inconsistent identities.
