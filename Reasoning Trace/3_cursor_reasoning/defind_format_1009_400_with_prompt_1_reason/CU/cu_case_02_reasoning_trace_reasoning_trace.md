## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR Standalone using `--rfsim` (RF simulator) with split CU/DU and a UE emulator. Expected bring-up: processes start → CU loads config and exposes F1-C endpoint → DU connects over F1AP (SCTP) → DU activates radio/time source → UE connects to RFsim server (TCP 4043) → SSB detect/PRACH → RRC → PDU session.

From the JSON:
- misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`
- CU logs show early config validation failures and immediate exit.
- DU logs show normal init, but repeated F1AP SCTP connection failures to the CU.
- UE logs show repeated RFsim TCP connection failures to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Network configuration (key inferred fields):
- `gnb_conf`: includes `gNBs.gNB_ID` and `tracking_area_code`. CU log flags `tracking_area_code=65535` as invalid (allowed 1..65533). The given misconfiguration `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is out of NR gNB-ID range: NR gNB-ID is 22 bits (max 0x3FFFFF/4194303); 0xFFFFFFFF exceeds that and fails OAI `config_execcheck`.
- `ue_conf`: carries RFsim address and frequencies consistent with Band n78/n48 around 3619 MHz; no direct misconfiguration indicated in UE config itself.

Initial mismatch summary:
- CU: invalid `gNB_ID` (and TAC) triggers `config_execcheck` failure → CU exits.
- DU: cannot complete F1 setup without CU → radio not activated.
- UE: cannot connect to RFsim TCP server (4043) because DU server is not yet listening until DU is activated post-F1 setup.

This aligns with a cascading failure rooted at the CU configuration error.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode confirmation: SA with RFsim.
- Version info present; RAN context shows `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` (CU build), as expected.
- Critical lines:
  - `config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 65535 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533`.
  - `[ENB_APP] [CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`.
  - `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.

Interpretation:
- The config checker validates ranges and enumerations before the process continues to NGAP/F1AP. An invalid `gNB_ID` and/or TAC causes an immediate exit. Given the prompt’s misconfigured parameter, `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is definitively invalid for NR (must fit 22-bit gNB-ID field per 38.413/38.331 RRC/NGAP usage and OAI constraints). The CU therefore never binds F1-C at `127.0.0.5` and never connects to AMF.

Cross-reference with `gnb_conf`:
- Ensure `gNBs.gNB_ID` is within 0..0x3FFFFF and `tracking_area_code` within 1..65533. The CU failure precedes any NGAP or GTPU setup, consistent with the logs ending at `exit_fun`.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU, TDD config, bandwidth (106 PRBs, µ=1), SSB frequency ~3619.2 MHz.
- F1AP client tries to connect: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3` → `F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` with `Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association ..., retrying...`.
- DU app states `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

Interpretation:
- CU is down, so F1-C on `127.0.0.5` does not accept SCTP. DU remains in a pre-activation state; RU/RFsim server side is not fully enabled to accept UE connections. No DU internal PHY/MAC assertion is present; the blocker is purely control-plane connectivity to CU.

Linked `gnb_conf` parameters:
- DU-side F1 endpoints are correct-format, but the dependency on CU availability makes DU stall. The root cause is still the CU config failure (invalid `gNB_ID` and TAC) rather than any DU misconfiguration.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for 106 PRBs at 3619.2 MHz, µ=1; multiple RX/TX actors spawned.
- RFsim client behavior: `Running as client`, tries `connect()` to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused).

Interpretation:
- In OAI RFsim, the gNB side (here, DU/RU process) typically opens the server socket on 4043 once the radio chain is activated. Because the DU is waiting for F1 Setup Response (CU down), it does not open/accept on 4043, so UE cannot connect. UE config appears otherwise consistent with the DU frequencies.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  1) CU exits immediately on configuration checks.
  2) DU cannot establish F1 SCTP to CU and remains inactive for radio.
  3) UE cannot connect to the RFsim server (4043) because DU never starts listening.

- Misconfigured parameter impact:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds allowed NR gNB-ID width (22-bit). OAI config checker treats this as invalid, causing immediate CU termination during `config_execcheck`.
  - CU log also shows `tracking_area_code=65535` which is out of allowed bounds (1..65533). Even if `gNB_ID` were fixed, TAC must also be corrected to pass validation.

- Standards and OAI behavior:
  - NR gNB-ID in NG-RAN is up to 22 bits; values must be ≤ 0x3FFFFF. Larger values are invalid for NGAP/RRC encoding.
  - OAI’s `config_execcheck` enforces these constraints early to avoid inconsistent identities on the S1/NG and F1 interfaces.

Conclusion: The root cause is the invalid CU configuration (`gNBs.gNB_ID` out of range, plus TAC out of range). This prevents CU startup, cascades to DU F1 failures, and ultimately to UE RFsim connection failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate configuration fixes in `gnb_conf`:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid 22-bit value, e.g., `0x000001` (decimal 1) or any value ≤ `0x3FFFFF` that matches your deployment plan.
- Set `tracking_area_code` to a valid value, e.g., `1` (ensure AMF/config alignment if used elsewhere).

Optional validations:
- Ensure CU and DU agree on F1-C IPs/ports (logs show DU connects to CU 127.0.0.5; keep CU bound accordingly).
- After fixing CU, verify DU transitions from “waiting for F1 Setup Response” to active radio and opens RFsim server; UE should then connect to 4043.

Proposed corrected snippets (within your `network_config` JSON structure). Comments explain changes.

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001",  // FIX: was 0xFFFFFFFF; NR gNB-ID must be ≤ 0x3FFFFF
        "tracking_area_code": 1  // FIX: was 65535; allowed range is 1..65533
      },
      "F1C": {
        "CU_addr": "127.0.0.5",  // Ensure CU process binds here
        "DU_addr": "127.0.0.3"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after applying the fix:
- Start CU; confirm no `config_execcheck` errors and that CU advertises F1-C.
- Start DU; verify F1AP Setup Request/Response completes; DU logs should then activate radio/time source and open RFsim.
- Start UE; confirm TCP connect to 4043 succeeds, SSB detection, RACH, and RRC attach proceed.

Additional tools/validation (if needed):
- If issues persist, check `ngap`, `f1ap`, and `rrc` logs with increased verbosity; confirm `cellIdentity`/`nrCellId` encoding matches the corrected `gNB_ID`.
- Ensure AMF/TAC/plmn configurations remain consistent across CU and core.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack timestamps; we infer ordering from content.
- Full `network_config` JSON is not included; corrected snippets target the clearly invalid fields flagged in logs and by the misconfigured parameter.
- The analysis assumes standard OAI RFsim behavior where DU enables the RFsim server post-F1 setup.
