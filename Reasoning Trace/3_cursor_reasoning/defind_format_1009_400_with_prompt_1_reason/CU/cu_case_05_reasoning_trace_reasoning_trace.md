## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
OAI 5G NR Standalone with `--rfsim` split CU/DU and a UE emulator. Expected flow: CU initializes (NGAP to AMF, F1-C server) → DU initializes and attempts F1 Setup to CU → DU activates radio/time source and opens RFsim server (TCP 4043) → UE connects to RFsim → SSB detect/PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.

Input highlights:
- misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (invalid; NR gNB-ID must be ≤ 22 bits → ≤ 0x3FFFFF).
- CU logs show config checks and an immediate exit due to invalid S-NSSAI SST: `sst: 256 invalid value` (allowed 0..255), then `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem`.
- DU logs show normal PHY/MAC init but repeated F1AP SCTP connect failures to CU (connection refused) and waiting for F1 Setup Response.
- UE logs show repeated RFsim TCP connect failures to `127.0.0.1:4043` (connection refused).

Network_config implications:
- `gnb_conf`: invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` (out-of-range) and invalid `plmn_list.snssaiList.sst` (=256) are both fatal in OAI config checks; CU never starts F1-C nor NGAP after failure.
- `ue_conf`: RFsim address/port and 3619.2 MHz appear consistent; UE-side config not the initiator of failure.

Initial mismatch summary:
- CU dies during configuration validation (invalid SST and out-of-range gNB_ID).
- DU cannot reach CU F1-C (SCTP connection refused) → radio not activated → RFsim server not opened.
- UE cannot connect to RFsim 4043 → no further procedures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode; tasks begin reading config.
- Critical messages:
  - `config_check_intrange: sst: 256 invalid value, authorized range: 0 255`.
  - `[CONFIG] config_execcheck: section ... snssaiList.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`.
  - `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- No NGAP/F1AP runtime messages thereafter in this run; CU exits before binding F1-C/NGAP. With the declared misconfigured `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, CU would also fail range checks or derive an inconsistent internal identity even if SST were corrected; both must be valid.

Cross-ref to `gnb_conf`:
- Fix `gNBs.gNB_ID` to ≤ 0x3FFFFF (22-bit) and ensure it matches DU’s view.
- Fix `plmn_list.snssaiList.sst` to 0..255 (typical SST=1 for eMBB or 1-digit values used in tests). Any invalid S-NSSAI results in immediate CU termination.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- PHY/MAC/RU init normal (TDD, 106 PRBs, µ=1, SSB at 3619200000 Hz). DU config shows valid TAC/MCC/MNC formatting in other runs; here the key issue is connectivity:
  - F1AP DU attempts to connect to CU `127.0.0.5`.
  - Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and “waiting for F1 Setup Response”.
- Interpretation: CU never brought up F1-C because it exited during config validation (invalid SST/gNB_ID). DU therefore cannot proceed to radio activation nor open RFsim server.

Link to `gnb_conf` params:
- F1 endpoints appear plausible; the blocker is CU availability, not DU PHY/MAC config.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes RF chains and parameters at 3619.2 MHz.
- Repeated attempts to connect to RFsim server `127.0.0.1:4043` fail with errno(111) (connection refused).
- Interpretation: In OAI RFsim, DU acts as the TCP server at 4043 after successful F1 Setup and radio activation. Since DU never completes F1, it never opens 4043; UE failures are a downstream effect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
1) CU config contains invalid fields: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (exceeds 22-bit limit) and `S-NSSAI SST=256` (exceeds 8-bit limit). CU fails `config_execcheck` and exits before advertising F1-C.
2) DU cannot connect F1AP to CU (connection refused) and stalls awaiting F1 Setup Response.
3) RFsim server is never opened by DU; UE cannot connect to 4043 and loops with connection refused.

Guided by misconfigured_param:
- Even if SST were correct, `gNB_ID` must be within 22-bit range and consistent across CU/DU; out-of-range or inconsistent identity leads to downstream NGAP/F1 issues. Here, the CU exits earlier due to SST, but `gNB_ID` still needs correction to ensure stable identity in NGAP/F1 once SST is fixed.

Standards/OAI references:
- gNB-ID ≤ 22 bits (3GPP, used in NGAP/F1 identity elements → values > 0x3FFFFF invalid).
- S-NSSAI SST is 8 bits (0..255 per 3GPP TS 23.501/24.501 usage in access stratum signalling). OAI enforces this in config checks.

Root cause: Invalid CU configuration with out-of-range `gNB_ID` and invalid S-NSSAI `sst=256`, causing `config_execcheck` failure and CU exit; DU and UE failures cascade from CU unavailability.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Make CU `gnb_conf` valid and consistent:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid 22-bit value (≤ `0x3FFFFF`) and use the same across CU/DU (example: `0x000E00` which is 3584, or `0x000001`).
- Set `plmn_list[0].snssaiList[0].sst` within 0..255 (example: `1`). Ensure AMF allows this S-NSSAI.
- Verify PLMN (MCC/MNC) and TAC are aligned with AMF and DU.
- Keep F1-C IPs consistent: DU connects to CU `127.0.0.5` if CU binds there.

Proposed corrected snippets (embedded in `network_config` format; comments explain fixes):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000E00",    // FIX: was 0xFFFFFFFF; must be ≤ 0x3FFFFF and match DU
        "plmn_list": [
          {

            "mnc": "01",
            "snssaiList": [
              { "sst": 1, "sd": "000001" }  // FIX: was 256; SST must be 0..255
            ]
          }
        ],
        "tracking_area_code": 1   // Ensure within 1..65533 and aligned with AMF/DU
      },
      "F1C": { "CU_addr": "127.0.0.5", "DU_addr": "127.0.0.3" },
      "NGAP": { "amf_addr": "192.168.8.43" }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,

      "snssai": { "sst": 1, "sd": "000001" }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after fixes:
- Start CU: confirm no `config_execcheck` errors; NGSetupRequest/Response succeeds; F1-C listening at `127.0.0.5`.
- Start DU: F1 Setup completes; DU activates radio and opens RFsim server (4043).
- Start UE: TCP connect to 4043 succeeds; SSB/PRACH and RRC attach proceed.

Further analysis:
- If NGAP still fails, verify PLMN/TAC/S-NSSAI with AMF configuration. Check `nrCellId`/`gNB-ID` encoding.
- If F1AP still fails, confirm CU/DU PLMN and identity match byte-for-byte; enable verbose F1AP/RRC logs.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and untimestamped; ordering inferred from content.
- Full `network_config` JSON not provided; snippets address fields directly implicated by logs and misconfigured_param.
- While guided by `gNB_ID` misconfig, the fatal error here is SST=256; both must be corrected for successful bring-up.
