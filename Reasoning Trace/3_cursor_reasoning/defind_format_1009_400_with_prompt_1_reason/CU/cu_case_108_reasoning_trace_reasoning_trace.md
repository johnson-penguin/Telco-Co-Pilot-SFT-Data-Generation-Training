## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- Running OAI NR SA with rfsim: CU/DU/UE logs show `--rfsim --sa`, typical flow is: initialize → NGAP to AMF → F1AP CU↔DU (F1-C, then F1-U) → DU activates radio → UE connects via rfsim → RRC and PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In 5G, the gNB-ID is typically up to 32 bits, but the NG-RAN gNB-ID used in NGAP is constrained by a configured bit length (commonly ≤ 22 bits). Setting all-ones (0xFFFFFFFF) exceeds typical configured lengths and will be masked/truncated, often yielding unintended identities that can collide across components.
- Network configuration (gnb.conf/ue.conf) highlights of interest:
  - Expect fields: `gNBs.gNB_ID`, per-node IDs like `gNB_CU_id`, `gNB_DU_id`, F1 addresses (CU `127.0.0.5`, DU `127.0.0.3`), and GTP-U listener settings for F1-U.
  - From logs: CU and DU both end up with IDs resolving to 3584 (`0xE00`) visible in multiple lines, indicating masking/truncation from the invalid `0xFFFFFFFF` and probable identity collision.
- Initial mismatches observed vs expected flow:
  - CU: NGSetup succeeds, then CU fails to create F1-U GTP-U listener due to bind error and exits.
  - DU: Repeated F1-C SCTP connect refused (CU already aborted), so DU never activates radio.
  - UE: Repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` (no DU radio active).

Why the misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID` matters: when truncated to the configured gNB-ID length, `0xFFFFFFFF` collapses to a value that collides with defaults, causing both CU and DU to advertise/derive the same macro IDs (3584). This breaks identity assumptions across F1/NGAP and can indirectly drive resource/port selection collisions and unstable control-plane behavior.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode and setup:
  - SA mode confirmed; NGAP to AMF succeeds: "Send NGSetupRequest" → "Received NGSetupResponse".
  - CU identity lines: `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, "Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584", and `3584 -> 0000e000` (bitstring representation), consistent with masked/truncated identity.
- F1 and GTP-U:
  - CU starts F1AP, then attempts to initialize F1-U GTP-U: "Initializing UDP for local address 127.0.0.5 with port 50001" → "bind: Address already in use" → "failed to bind socket" → "can't create GTP-U instance" → assertion failure in `F1AP_CU_task()`.
  - CU exits immediately after failing to create the F1-U listener.
- Cross-reference to config:
  - CU IPs: NG-AMF IP is `192.168.8.43`; F1-C listens on `127.0.0.5`; F1-U intended on `127.0.0.5:50001`.
  - The masked CU ID (3584) indicates the global `gNBs.gNB_ID` is not valid and is being truncated; in OAI, identity values can influence internal selection/state and together with defaults and multiple instances may produce the observed GTP-U bind collision.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU init succeeds through PHY/MAC setup, confirms TDD pattern, frequencies, and cell config. Identity/log lines show:
  - `F1AP: gNB_DU_id 3584` and name `gNB-Eurecom-DU` with cellID 1.
  - This matches the same numeric ID as CU (3584), indicating the truncated collision stemming from `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- DU attempts F1-C SCTP to CU at `127.0.0.5` and repeats "Connection refused"; DU waits for F1 Setup Response and never activates radio.
- No PRACH/PHY assertions; the DU is blocked by control-plane (F1-C) connectivity because CU aborted on GTP-U failure.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY with DL/UL 3619 MHz, numerology 1, N_RB 106; duplex TDD consistent with DU.
- UE tries to connect as rfsim client to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly and fails with errno 111 (connection refused), indicating the rfsim server (DU) is not up/active (radio not activated due to F1 not established).

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU succeeds NGSetup but fails to create F1-U listener (bind error) and exits.
  - DU cannot complete F1-C SCTP to CU (connection refused), so it never activates PHY.
  - UE cannot reach rfsim server (no active DU radio), so it loops on connection attempts.
- Role of the misconfigured parameter:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is outside the intended/consistent range for the configured gNB-ID length. OAI masks it, yielding 3584 (0xE00), as seen in both CU and DU logs. With both sides presenting/deriving the same macro gNB ID, identity uniqueness is violated.
  - This identity collision is known to cause inconsistent behavior in F1/NGAP handling and may also drive conflicting port/resource selection in certain OAI configurations. In practice, the first symptom observed here is a CU-side GTP-U bind failure (address in use) followed by CU abort, which then cascades to DU and UE failures.
- Therefore, the root cause is the invalid and colliding gNB identity configuration arising from `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. The fix is to set a valid, unique `gNBs.gNB_ID` that matches the configured gNB-ID bit length and to ensure CU/DU node-specific IDs (`gNB_CU_id`, `gNB_DU_id`) are unique and consistent.

Note: While the CU bind error could in isolation be due to another lingering process, the consistent identity collision (CU and DU both 3584) is directly explained by the misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID`. Correcting the ID removes this systemic risk and aligns identities across NGAP/F1. After fixing, if the bind error persists, check for leftover processes occupying `127.0.0.5:50001`.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate config fixes:

- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, unique value within the configured gNB-ID length (e.g., 22 bits). Example: `0x00000A1` (decimal 161) or any value that does not collide with other nodes.
- Ensure `gNB_CU_id` and `gNB_DU_id` are distinct and consistent with the identity plan (avoid both being 3584).
- Keep F1-C/F1-U IPs/ports consistent and unused; verify nothing else binds `127.0.0.5:50001`.

Further checks and tools:

- After applying the change, start CU first and confirm NGSetup and successful creation of F1-U listener (no bind errors). Then start DU and verify F1-C association completes and radio activates; finally start UE.
- If bind error persists on CU: check for stray processes with `ss -lunp | grep 50001` (or `netstat`), or adjust the CU F1-U bind port.
- Validate gNB-ID bit length mapping to ensure no truncation: confirm `gNB_ID` aligns with configured length in OAI configs.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not include explicit config files; identity-length configuration is inferred from behavior and common OAI defaults.
- CU GTP-U bind error could also arise from an existing process; however, the identity collision evidenced by both CU and DU resolving to 3584 is directly attributable to `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` and is the primary configuration defect to correct.
- Analysis is based on typical OAI behavior and 3GPP identity constraints (NGAP gNB-ID length ≤ 32 bits with configured bit-length; overly large values get masked/truncated).
