## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs show OAI NR SA mode with RF Simulator: both CU/DU print "running in SA mode" and UE runs with rfsimulator client repeatedly trying `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected call flow in SA+rfsim: CU starts and listens for F1-C (SCTP); DU connects to CU and completes F1 Setup; DU then activates radio and starts the rfsim server; UE connects to the rfsim server, synchronizes to SSB, performs PRACH/RA, RRC setup, NAS registration, and PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter provided: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (from `gnb.conf`). In NGAP, `gNB-ID` is encoded as a bit string with a size of 22 bits; values beyond 22 bits (e.g., `0xFFFFFFFF` which is 32 bits) are invalid and typically cause config validation or ASN.1 encoding failures.

Parsed network_config (key items inferred from logs and typical OAI config):
- gnb_conf: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (misconfigured), CU F1-C IP likely `127.0.0.5`, DU F1-C IP `127.0.0.3`, TDD config present, SSB DL frequency 3619200000 Hz (band 78/48 prints differ; log shows band 48 line but `absoluteFrequencySSB` maps to 3.6192 GHz which is n78; OAI sometimes prints band 48 for rfsim placeholder).
- ue_conf: rfsimulator `serveraddr=127.0.0.1:4043`, numerology 1, N_RB 106, DL/UL freq 3.6192 GHz.

Initial mismatch signals:
- CU logs stop early after config reading; no F1AP start, no SCTP listener. A warning shows unknown ciphering algorithm `nea9`, but OAI treats unknown extra algorithms as a warning (it falls back to supported sets). The more critical suspect is the invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID`.
- DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect to CU (`Connection refused`) and prints "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio". This blocks rfsim server startup, causing UE’s repeated `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)`.

Conclusion for setup: The CU likely fails to start F1 due to invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID`, cascading to DU F1 connection failures and UE rfsim connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU confirms SA mode and prints build info.
- It initializes RAN context with `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0`, consistent with CU-only process.
- It shows `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` (this is an internal identifier; not necessarily the configured `gNBs.gNB_ID`).
- Warnings: `unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9"` — non-fatal in practice; CU should ignore unsupported algorithms.
- Critical observation: There is no line indicating F1AP listener startup, SCTP bind, or NGAP/AMF connection. The log ends shortly after repeated "Reading 'GNBSParams' section" lines.

Cross-reference to config:
- If `gNBs.gNB_ID` exceeds allowed bit length, CU config parsing and/or ASN.1 struct preparation for NGAP/F1 may assert/fail, preventing task threads (F1-C) from starting. This matches the observed truncation of CU logs and the DU’s inability to connect.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU fine: antenna counts, TDD pattern, frequencies, numerology, RBs, and SIB1 derivations print normally — no PHY/MAC crash.
- DU attempts to start F1AP and connect to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with retries. DU remains in `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- Since DU awaits F1 Setup Response to activate radio and start rfsim server, UE-side RFsim client cannot connect.

Link to gnb_conf:
- DU’s behavior is consistent with a healthy DU whose peer CU is not listening. This aligns with CU failing early (likely due to `gNBs.gNB_ID` invalidity).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY for SA at 3.6192 GHz, numerology 1, N_RB 106.
- It repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (rfsimulator port) and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused). This indicates the rfsim server was never started by the gNB side.
- No PRACH, RRC, or NAS activity is seen, because RF connectivity to the gNB simulator never establishes.

Mapping to ue_conf:
- UE’s rfsim parameters appear fine; the issue is server availability (blocked at DU due to missing F1 activation).

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU likely aborts or skips F1 task init after config read due to invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` (32-bit all-ones vs required 22-bit max). No F1 listener.
  - DU cannot connect to CU F1-C (`Connection refused`) and never activates radio, thus never starts rfsim server.
  - UE, acting as rfsim client, continually fails to connect to the absent server.

- Root cause guided by misconfigured_param:
  - In NGAP, `gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING constrained to size 22. Values must be within the range [0, 2^22 - 1] (i.e., `<= 0x3FFFFF`). Setting `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` violates the constraint, leading to config validation failure or ASN.1 encoding failure for Global gNB ID, which prevents CU from bringing up control-plane tasks (F1, NGAP).

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix the gNB ID:
  - Choose a valid 22-bit value, e.g., `gNBs.gNB_ID=0x00000E00` (decimal 3584) to align with the printed `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and DU’s `gNB_DU_id 3584`, or any other value within `0x000000`–`0x3FFFFF` that is unique in your deployment.

- After change, expected behavior:
  - CU starts F1 and NGAP tasks; DU’s SCTP connection succeeds; F1 Setup completes; DU activates radio and starts rfsim server; UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceeds with SSB/PRACH/RA and RRC/NAS procedures.

- Additional sanity checks:
  - Keep only supported security algorithms in `security` section (e.g., `nea0/nea1/nea2` and `nia0/nia1/nia2`). The `nea9` warning is non-fatal but should be removed for cleanliness.
  - Verify CU `F1AP_CU.IP` matches DU’s `F1AP_CU` target (`127.0.0.5`) and that CU binds properly.

- Corrected config snippets (JSON-form within `network_config` style; comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000E00"  // fixed: valid 22-bit value (was 0xFFFFFFFF)
      },
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_IP": "127.0.0.5",   // ensure CU listens here
        "DU_IP": "127.0.0.3"    // DU connects from here
      },
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea1", "nea2", "nea0"], // remove unsupported "nea9"
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia1", "nia2", "nia0"]
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1:4043"
      },
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "numerology": 1,
        "n_rb_dl": 106
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Operational steps:
  1) Update `gnb.conf` with a valid `gNBs.gNB_ID` and remove `nea9`.
  2) Start CU; confirm F1 listener via logs.
  3) Start DU; confirm F1 Setup completes and radio activates.
  4) Start UE; confirm rfsim connects and RA proceeds.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and lack explicit CU fatal error lines. The diagnosis leans on the provided misconfigured parameter and well-known NGAP `gNB-ID` bit-length constraints.
- Frequency/band print inconsistency (band 48 line vs n78 frequency) is common in rfsim traces and not material here.
- No `ue_conf` JSON object was explicitly provided; the suggested snippet follows OAI defaults matching the logs.
