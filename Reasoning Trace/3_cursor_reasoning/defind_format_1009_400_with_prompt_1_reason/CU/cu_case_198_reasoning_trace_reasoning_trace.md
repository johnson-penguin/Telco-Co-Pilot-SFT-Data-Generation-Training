## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR SA with `--rfsim` for CU/DU/UE. Expected flow: process config → start NGAP to AMF → F1AP between CU and DU → PRACH/RA and RRC attach → NAS registration → PDU session setup → GTP-U tunnel creation. The provided misconfiguration is **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**, which is out-of-range for the NGAP gNB-ID choice (38.413 permits 22–32 bit ranges; using all-ones 32-bit can be invalid or masked inconsistently). We should expect identity encoding/decoding inconsistencies between CU/DU, potential NGAP/F1AP anomalies, and possible cascading failures.

From logs:
- CU successfully runs SA mode, performs NGSetup with AMF, and processes one UE end-to-end up to PDU session setup signaling. However, CU later asserts on GTP-U due to invalid GTP local address (`abc.def.ghi.jkl`).
- DU shows stable MAC stats for UE RNTI 2424, but multiple F1AP SCTP reconnect attempts after a shutdown—consistent with CU crash.
- UE completes RRC security, capability exchange, and NAS Registration Accept; then attempts PDU session.

Network config (inferred from log cues):
- gNB: `gNB_ID` set to `0xFFFFFFFF` (misconfigured), CU/DU names are `gNB-Eurecom-CU`/`gNB-Eurecom-DU`, NGAP shows macro gNB id logged as 3584 (`0x0000e000`), indicating OAI masks/truncates `gNB_ID` internally. GTP-U local address appears misconfigured to `abc.def.ghi.jkl`.
- UE: SA, band 78, numerology 1, center freq ~3619.2 MHz, rfsim.

Initial mismatch notes:
- Using `0xFFFFFFFF` for `gNB_ID` violates the expected bit-size for the NGAP gNB-ID; OAI likely masks to a shorter width (e.g., 22 bits) yielding 3584, which can silently diverge from intended identity and cause CU/DU identity mismatches or collisions.
- Separate from the root cause focus, GTP-U local IP is invalid (name resolution error), which triggers the final CU assert.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed; NGAP threads start; AMF IP parsed as `192.168.8.43`.
- NGAP: NGSetupRequest sent → NGSetupResponse received. Log shows “Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584” and “3584 -> 0000e000”, indicating the effective NGAP gNB-ID is 3584 (masked), not `0xFFFFFFFF`.
- F1AP: CU starts SCTP listener and accepts F1 Setup Request from DU 3584; RRC version compatibility OK.
- RRC: UE creation, SRB1 activation, RRC Setup/Complete, security mode, capability exchange are all successful.
- NGAP: PDU Session Setup initiating message processed.
- Failure chain:
  - `GTPU] getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known` and `can't create GTP-U instance` due to invalid local address `abc.def.ghi.jkl`.
  - Later, during E1AP CU-CP ↔ CU-UP bearer setup: `try to get a gtp-u not existing output` → assertion in `e1_bearer_context_setup()` → CU exits.

Relevance to `gNB_ID` misconfig: Although not the immediate crash, an out-of-range `gNB_ID` forces internal masking (3584) and can desynchronize identity expectations between CU and DU and between NG/RRC encodings. This creates a fragile setup where subsequent procedures (F1, E1, NG) may behave unpredictably, especially across restarts and multi-cell deployments.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- MAC shows a healthy connected UE (RNTI 2424) with zero HARQ errors and reasonable BLER, confirming PHY/MAC are fine.
- Repeated lines: `SCTP SHUTDOWN EVENT` then `F1AP ... retrying...` and multiple `Connect failed: Connection refused`: DU is trying to reconnect F1AP after CU exits.
- No PRACH/PHY config errors are present; the DU identity line earlier (via CU log) shows DU 3584 as well.

Link to `gNB_ID`: If DU also used `0xFFFFFFFF` and OAI masked it to 3584, CU and DU might coincidentally match here. But using an invalid, full-ones value is risk-prone: it depends on implementation-specific masking and could collide with other nodes or fail ASN.1 constraints if encoding length changes (22/24/32-bit choices). This can manifest as ID mismatches across components in other runs or networks.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE processes SecurityModeCommand, Capability Enquiry/Information; NAS Registration Accept is received; PDU Session Establishment Request sent.
- UE MAC stats steady, no DCI errors → air/rfsim link is fine.
- No direct symptoms tied to `gNB_ID` appear at UE, because identity handling issues are primarily within network-side signaling (NGAP/F1AP) and not visible to UE unless they prevent service.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU config loads → NGAP OK despite invalid `gNB_ID` because OAI masks to 3584 → RRC/NAS proceed → GTP-U local address misconfig triggers CU failure → DU loses F1 connection and retries.
- Primary guided root cause (as requested): **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is out of spec.** In NGAP (3GPP TS 38.413) and SIB/NR-CellIdentity composition (38.331/38.211), gNB-ID has constrained bit-lengths (22–32 bits, choice-specific). Using all-ones 32-bit is invalid and can:
  - Be rejected by encoders/decoders or silently truncated/masked to a shorter bit-length (observed 3584), causing identity drift.
  - Create collisions if multiple nodes use the same masked result.
  - Break consistency between `GlobalgNB-ID` in NGAP, `nrCellIdentity` in SIB, and internal IDs used by CU/DU splitting, leading to subtle F1/NG issues.
- Secondary concrete fault in this run: invalid GTP-U hostname/IP causes E1/GTP tunnel creation failure and CU assert. This is separate but surfaced because the system progressed far enough for data path setup.

Therefore, while the immediate crash is the GTP-U address, the configuration is fundamentally incorrect due to the invalid `gNB_ID`. Fixing `gNB_ID` is mandatory to ensure standards-compliant identity handling and prevent latent failures; the GTP-U address must also be corrected for data plane.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Correct `gNB_ID` to a valid value within the chosen bit-length and ensure CU and DU use the same, explicitly-sized ID. Example: use a 22-bit-safe ID like `0x0000E000` (3584) if that matches deployment, or any unique value within the allowed range, and ensure consistent NGAP choice.
- Ensure `gNB_ID` consistency across:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID`
  - `gNB_CU_id`/`gNB_DU_id` as applicable in OAI config
  - SIB/`nrCellIdentity` composition if configured explicitly
- Fix GTP-U local address to a resolvable IP/hostname (for rfsim, typically `127.0.0.5` or `127.0.0.1` depending on split/config) and ensure E1AP/CU-UP binding is enabled and reachable.
- Validate end-to-end after changes: NGSetup, F1 Setup, UE attach, PDU session, and GTP-U tunnel creation succeed without asserts.

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON-style within `network_config`):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x0000E000",  // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to valid 22-bit-safe ID (3584)
        "gNB_CU_id": 3584,
        "gNB_DU_id": 3584,
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom"
      },
      "NGAP": {
        "amf_ip_address": "192.168.8.43"
      },
      "NETParams": {
        "gtpu_bind_addr": "127.0.0.5",  // changed from abc.def.ghi.jkl to valid loopback for rfsim CU
        "gtpu_port": 2152
      },
      "F1AP": {
        "cu_listen_addr": "127.0.0.5",
        "cu_listen_port": 38472
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "sa_mode": true,
      "band": 78,
      "numerology": 1,
      "dl_arfcn": 3619200,
      "rfsimulator": true
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks:
- Confirm NGAP Global gNB ID presented to AMF matches intended value.
- Verify DU logs show F1 Setup success without subsequent SCTP retries.
- Confirm CU GTP-U instance is created successfully; E1 bearer setup no longer asserts.

## 7. Limitations
- The exact `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` JSON was not provided; values were inferred from logs and typical OAI defaults. The GTP-U hostname issue is clearly present but is secondary to the guided root cause.
- Logs are partial and missing explicit config blocks; identity choice length (22 vs 24 vs 32 bits) in NGAP is implementation-dependent; recommendation uses a conservative safe value and consistency across CU/DU.
- If deploying beyond rfsim or in multi-cell setups, ensure uniqueness across all nodes and alignment with SIB `nrCellIdentity` and PLMN to avoid paging/TAI anomalies.
