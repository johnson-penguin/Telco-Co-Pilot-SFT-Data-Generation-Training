## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The system runs OAI `nr-softmodem` in SA with `--rfsim` for CU, DU, and UE. Expected sequence: CU/DU init → F1-C association (SCTP) → CU↔AMF (NGAP) → DU activates radio → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB/PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In 5G NR, `gNB_ID` contributes to Global gNB ID used by F1AP/NGAP. It has a configured bit-length (commonly 22..32). An all-ones 32-bit value is often invalid (out-of-range for selected bit-length or rejected by validation), breaking identity encoding and control-plane bring-up.
- The input lacks explicit `network_config` with `gnb_conf`/`ue_conf`. We infer from logs:
  - CU: `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU`; no evidence of F1-C listen socket.
  - DU: `gNB_DU_id 3584`, tries F1-C to CU at `127.0.0.5`, repeatedly refused.
  - UE: RFsim client repeatedly attempts `127.0.0.1:4043` and is refused, consistent with DU not activating radio due to missing F1 Setup.

Initial flags:
- DU’s repeated SCTP `Connection refused` implies CU did not bind/listen F1-C, likely due to config validation failure early. An invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` at CU can prevent F1AP/NGAP initialization.
- UE RFsim connect failures are a downstream effect of DU waiting on F1 Setup Response before starting RFsim server/radio.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode, shows build info, initializes RAN context with `RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` (CU-only). It reads `GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, etc. There’s a warning about `nea9` cipher (unsupported), but that usually doesn’t block F1.
- Missing: no lines showing F1AP server starting or SCTP bind/listen; no NGAP/AMF activity. This aligns with the DU’s `Connection refused` when dialing CU at `127.0.0.5`.
- Hypothesis: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` causes identity/ASN configuration failure at CU, so F1AP server isn’t started.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC (TDD pattern, numerology µ=1, N_RB=106, SIB1, timers). Then starts F1AP client and attempts SCTP to CU `127.0.0.5` from DU `127.0.0.3`.
- SCTP repeatedly fails with `Connection refused`; DU logs `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`. No PHY crashes/asserts; it’s control-plane blocked.
- Conclusion: DU is healthy; CU is not listening, preventing F1 setup.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes matching RF parameters (3619.2 MHz DL/UL, µ=1, N_RB=106, TDD). It tries to connect to RFsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` repeatedly.
- This is expected since DU’s RFsim server typically comes up only after F1 Setup and gNB activation; DU is blocked, so UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence correlation:
  - CU parses config, but F1AP server not started → DU SCTP refused.
  - DU stuck waiting for F1 Setup Response → no radio/RFsim server.
  - UE can’t connect to RFsim → cascading effect.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured parameter: invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` at CU (`0xFFFFFFFF`) likely exceeds configured bit-length or is treated as invalid, causing identity encoding to fail and F1/NGAP not to initialize.
- This explains all three components’ symptoms without PHY errors.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value that fits the configured bit-length (for 22-bit: max `4194303`; for 32-bit: ensure proper config). Use a small, unique ID (e.g., `4096` or `0x1000`). Ensure CU/DU identity expectations remain consistent.

Corrected configuration snippets (representative; adapt to your environment):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "gNB_ID": 4096,  // fix: previously 0xFFFFFFFF (invalid), now bounded example
          "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
          "F1AP": {
            "CU_f1c_listen_ip": "127.0.0.5",   // ensure CU binds/listens here
            "DU_f1c_target_ip": "127.0.0.3"
          },
          "amf_ip_address": [
            { "ipv4": "127.0.0.18", "active": true, "preference": "ipv4" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": { "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", "serverport": 4043 },
      "rf": { "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000, "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000, "band": 78, "n_rb_dl": 106, "scs_khz": 30 }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational validation after fix:
- CU logs should show F1AP server startup and SCTP listen; DU should report successful SCTP association followed by `F1 Setup Response` and radio activation; UE should connect to RFsim 4043.
- Optionally correct the `nea9` cipher to a supported one (`nea0/nea2/nea3`) to avoid later RRC security issues (non-blocking for F1).

## 7. Limitations
- No explicit `network_config` JSON provided; field names/structure above are representative for OAI and inferred from logs.
- CU logs do not show explicit ASN or bind failure messages; diagnosis is inferred from DU’s repeated `Connection refused` and the known invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` misconfiguration.
- If issues persist, increase CU F1AP/NGAP log verbosity to capture identity/ASN initialization errors and verify configured gNB ID bit-length.
