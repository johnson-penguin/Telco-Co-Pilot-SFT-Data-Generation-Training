## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

We analyze an OAI 5G NR Standalone (SA) setup using RF simulator (`--rfsim`, `--sa`). Expected flow: CU/DU/UE initialization → F1-C association (DU↔CU over SCTP) → CU NGAP to core (not shown here) → DU radio activation → UE connects to RFsim server and performs cell search/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session. The input declares the misconfiguration upfront: `misconfigured_param = gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.

From logs:
- CU/DU/UE all run in SA and rfsim modes. CU shows config parsing including `GNBSParams`; DU attempts F1 to CU but SCTP connect is repeatedly refused; UE repeatedly fails to connect to RFsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` (connection refused).
- CU also flags a separate invalid `drb_integrity` value, but that is orthogonal to `gNB_ID` and not blocking F1/SCTP by itself.

Assumptions consistent with OAI defaults in rfsim SA:
- DU runs RFsim server; UE acts as client to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- F1-C uses SCTP between DU (`127.0.0.3`) and CU (`127.0.0.5`).
- `gNB_ID` participates in the NR Cell Global Identifier (NR-CGI) derivation and in F1AP identity; values outside spec ranges can trigger identity encoding/validation failures early.

Network configuration (from provided context):
- gnb_conf: `gNBs.gNB_ID = 0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all-ones). This already contradicts 3GPP constraints where `gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING of length 22 bits in NR (max `0x3FFFFF`). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` overflows the allowed bit-length and typically should be rejected or truncated. Other relevant DU settings in logs: DL freq 3619200000 Hz (n78), µ=1, N_RB=106, TDD pattern index 6. F1 DU IP 127.0.0.3, CU IP 127.0.0.5.
- ue_conf: Not explicitly provided, but UE logs show TDD, DL freq 3619200000, µ=1, N_RB=106, and RFsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Initial mismatch: `gNB_ID` invalid by spec; expect early control-plane failures (e.g., F1AP Setup Request encoding/validation, or CU-side reject), which cascades to DU not activating radio and UE connection failing.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Key CU lines:
- SA/rfsim confirmed; RAN context initialized with no MAC/RLC/L1 instances (CU-split): `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` is normal for CU.
- F1AP identity: `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- Config parsing includes `GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`.
- Error: `bad drb_integrity value 'invalid_enum_value'` (should be 'yes' or 'no'). This is a warning impacting bearer config but not F1 association establishment per se.

Notably absent are lines indicating successful F1 Setup from DU (no F1AP Setup Request/Response) and no SCTP server accept. Given DU shows repeated SCTP connect refused, the CU is either not listening yet or rejects association (e.g., due to malformed identity IE caused by invalid `gNB_ID` when DU encodes F1 Setup Request and CU validates). CU logs shown are truncated and don’t display SCTP listener state, but the DU’s persistent refusal implies the CU side is not accepting the association.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU and RF parameters correctly (n78, µ=1, N_RB=106). It brings up threads and enters F1AP client mode:
- `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` then `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused`, with retries. DU remains in `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` loop, so RFsim server (downlink/uplink samples) is not activated for UE.

No PHY assertions or PRACH errors; the block is at control-plane association. This is consistent with identity/config problems causing the CU to reject or not handle the F1 association. In OAI, DU will not activate radio until F1 Setup is complete.

Link to `gNB_ID`: In F1AP Setup Request, the DU includes `gNB-DU ID` and the served cells with NR-CGI derived from PLMN + `gNB-ID` + Cell ID. If `gNB_ID` exceeds allowed length, ASN.1 encoding may fail or CU validation may reject, resulting effectively in no established SCTP association or immediate abort. The DU log prints only the SCTP connect refusal because higher-layer setup never proceeds.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

UE is correctly configured for same numerology and frequency. It runs as RFsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111) Connection refused`. This indicates the RFsim server (owned by DU) never started listening. That aligns with DU being stuck waiting for F1 Setup Response and not activating radio/simulator sockets.

Thus, UE failures are downstream symptoms of DU not reaching active state due to control-plane association issues.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Correlation:
- CU: config parsed; no evidence of F1 accept; separate `drb_integrity` warning.
- DU: infinite SCTP connect refused to CU; stays pre-activation.
- UE: connection refused to RFsim server; DU never served.

Root cause guided by `misconfigured_param`:
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` violates 3GPP NR constraints. In 3GPP TS 38.473 (F1AP) and 38.413/38.413-like identities, the `gNB-ID` used in NR-CGI is 22 bits. Valid range: 0 … 0x3FFFFF. OAI expects a value that fits and typically checks or uses a mask during ASN.1 encoding. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` can cause:
  - Encoding failure or truncation leading to mismatch CU-side validation
  - Inconsistent NR-CGI construction causing CU to reject Setup
  - Potential config parser bounds check leading to silently invalid state

This explains why DU cannot establish F1 and why UE cannot connect to RFsim server.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Actionable fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid 22-bit value, unique within network. Examples: `0x1` or `0xABCDE` (≤ 0x3FFFFF).
- Also fix unrelated CU warning: set `drb_integrity` to `"yes"` or `"no"`.
- Restart CU → wait listening, then start DU, confirm F1 Setup completes, then start UE.

Validated configuration snippets (JSON-style, illustrative):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "gNB_ID": "0x0001",  // FIX: valid 22-bit value (max 0x3FFFFF)
          "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom",
          "tac": 1,
          "plmn_list": [ { "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" } ],
          "amf_ip": "127.0.0.1",
          "f1cu_ip": "127.0.0.5",
          "f1du_ip": "127.0.0.3",
          "drb_integrity": "yes" // FIX: was invalid_enum_value
        }
      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "mode": "rfsim",
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043
      },
      "cell_search": {
        "absoluteFrequencySSB": 641280,
        "nrb": 106,
        "numerology": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Verification steps:
- After changes, CU log should show SCTP server/listening and accept; DU should show `F1AP: Got F1 Setup Response`, then `Activating radio` and RFsim server startup; UE should connect to RFsim and proceed to SSB detection and random access.
- If still failing, enable higher verbosity for F1AP/ASN.1 on CU to capture identity decoding errors; check OAI config parser for `gNB_ID` masking/validation.

## 7. Limitations

- Provided logs are truncated and omit explicit CU SCTP listener/accept traces and any ASN.1/F1AP error printouts, so rejection is inferred from DU/UE behavior and known constraints.
- Exact `network_config` objects for `gnb_conf` and `ue_conf` are not fully shown; snippets above illustrate required fixes based on the misconfigured parameter and observed logs.
- Specification references (gNB-ID 22 bits) derive from NR definitions used in NR-CGI and F1AP identity IEs; implementers may enforce via bounds checks or masks, but behavior on overflow varies.
