## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs show an OAI SA deployment using rfsim: CU/DU split with F1-C between DU (127.0.0.3) and CU (127.0.0.5); UE uses the rfsimulator client attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected nominal flow: CU and DU load configs → CU initializes NGAP/GTP and F1-C server → DU boots NR PHY/MAC and initiates F1-C SCTP → upon F1 Setup, DU activates radio → UE connects via rfsim, synchronizes SSB, performs RACH → RRC attach and PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF. This value is out-of-policy for OAI’s configuration handling and/or exceeds internal bounds, causing parsing/validation failure. The CU logs already show a configuration parse error (libconfig) and an aborted init.
- From network_config (gnb_conf/ue_conf assumed extracted): key items to watch:
  - gNB: gNBs.gNB_ID, F1 endpoints (DU: 127.0.0.3, CU: 127.0.0.5), band/numerology (mu=1, N_RB=106), frequency ~3.6192 GHz, TDD config, PRACH params (not directly implicated here).
  - UE: rfsimulator_serveraddr 127.0.0.1:4043, band/numerology matching SSB DL frequency and N_RB 106.
- Initial mismatch snapshot:
  - CU fails to load config due to syntax/validation error, thus no F1-C listening socket on 127.0.0.5.
  - DU repeatedly gets F1 SCTP connection refused.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 (no server spawned because gNB side never reached active state).

Conclusion for setup: A CU-side configuration fatal error blocks the entire chain. The misconfigured gNBs.gNB_ID drives this outcome.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Key lines:
  - "[LIBCONFIG] ... line 11: syntax error"
  - "config module \"libconfig\" couldn't be loaded"
  - "init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed"
  - CMDLINE indicates SA + rfsim with the failing config file.
- Interpretation:
  - The CU never gets past configuration parsing. In OAI, gNBs.gNB_ID may be parsed under a specific type (often 32-bit signed or constrained range for gNB-ID per 38.413: 22..32 bits). Value 0xFFFFFFFF can overflow internal signed int, violate range checks, or trigger additional validation logic mapping to RRC/NGAP identifiers.
  - "syntax error" can also mean libconfig rejected the tokenization/format (e.g., hex not allowed here, missing semicolon, or range violation surfaced as syntax error). Since misconfigured_param explicitly highlights gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF, we attribute the fatal parsing to this field.
- Impact:
  - CU does not bind SCTP for F1-C; DU will see connection refused.
  - No NGAP/AMF activity occurs; entire network remains inactive.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly: numerology mu=1, N_RB=106, DL/UL frequencies 3619200000 Hz, TDD pattern configured, SIB1 derived params printed.
- F1AP client side tries to connect:
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5"
  - Repeated: "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" followed by "[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying..."
- Interpretation:
  - Connection refused indicates no process is listening at 127.0.0.5: F1-C server didn’t come up because CU initialization aborted.
- No PRACH/PHY crash signatures (e.g., no PRACH assertion or L_ra/NCS issues). DU is stalled waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio fully.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE config is consistent with DU: DL freq 3619200000, N_RB_DL 106, TDD.
- UE acts as rfsimulator client attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, repeatedly failing with errno(111) (connection refused).
- Interpretation:
  - The rfsim server on the gNB side was never started. In the CU/DU split rfsim setup, server creation depends on the gNB process reaching a ready/active state. Since CU failed and DU is blocked on F1, the rfsim server is absent, causing UE connection failures.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU fails immediately at configuration parse → no F1-C listener on 127.0.0.5.
  - DU attempts F1-C connect → gets "connection refused" in a loop.
  - UE attempts to connect to rfsim server (127.0.0.1:4043) → "connection refused" loop.
- Misconfigured parameter linkage:
  - gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF is the pointed culprit. OAI’s config expects a valid gNB-ID range aligned with 3GPP TS 38.413 (gNB-ID is BIT STRING size 22..32). Practically, OAI often restricts to non-negative 32-bit integers and, in some builds, disallows 0xFFFFFFFF due to special meanings or signed overflow. Some OAI modules also expect decimal form rather than hex in libconfig for this field.
- Hypothesis:
  - Setting gNBs.gNB_ID to 0xFFFFFFFF triggers libconfig parsing/validation failure (either due to disallowed hexadecimal, out-of-range sentinel, or signed overflow), causing CU init abort. This cascades to DU F1AP failures and UE rfsim connection refusals.
- Optional spec/code cross-check (external knowledge):
  - 3GPP TS 38.413 defines gNB-ID bit-length constraints (22..32). Using all-ones value can conflict with internal bit handling or sentinel usage. OAI historically stores IDs in signed 32-bit fields and serializes to ASN.1/NGAP, where invalid ranges are trapped early.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Immediate fix:
  - Use a valid, conservative gNBs.gNB_ID within expected bounds and format. Recommended: small positive decimal (e.g., 26) or a 32-bit value well below 0x7FFFFFFF if hex is supported. Ensure proper libconfig syntax (semicolon-terminated entries).
- After change, verify:
  - CU boot completes, F1-C server listens, DU receives F1 Setup Response, radio activates, and UE connects to rfsim server.
- Additional hardening:
  - Keep gNB-ID consistent across CU/DU references if duplicated.
  - Prefer decimal representation in libconfig for IDs to avoid hex parsing ambiguity.

- Corrected network_config snippets (JSON-style with comments explaining changes):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        // Changed from 0xFFFFFFFF (invalid/unsupported) to 26 (valid small positive decimal)
        "gNB_ID": 26,
        // ... other gNB parameters remain unchanged ...
        "F1": {
          "CU_addr": "127.0.0.5",
          "DU_addr": "127.0.0.3"
        },
        "NR_frequency": 3619200000,
        "N_RB": 106,
        "duplex_mode": "TDD"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change needed; UE was configured consistently
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
      "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
      "NR_frequency": 3619200000,
      "N_RB": 106,
      "duplex_mode": "TDD"
    }
  }
}
```

- Operational checks after fix:
  - Confirm CU log shows successful config parse and NGAP/F1 init.
  - Confirm DU log shows F1 Setup Complete and "activating radio".
  - Confirm UE log shows successful rfsim TCP connect, SSB detection, RACH, and RRC connection.

## 7. Limitations

- CU log only shows a generic libconfig "syntax error" at line 11; precise parser reason isn’t printed. We attribute the failure to gNBs.gNB_ID based on the given misconfigured_param and typical OAI constraints.
- The exact acceptable range/format for gNBs.gNB_ID can vary across OAI commits; if 0xFFFFFFFF is theoretically permitted by the spec, OAI’s implementation may still reject it due to signed int handling or sentinel use.
- Logs are truncated; timestamps and full configs are not provided. If the issue persists after changing gNBs.gNB_ID, re-check for punctuation (semicolons), section names, and any other nearby fields on the cited line.
