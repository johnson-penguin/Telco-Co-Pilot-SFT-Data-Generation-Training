## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is OAI 5G NR Standalone with RFsim (logs show "--rfsim --sa"). Expected flow: CU and DU start, establish F1-C over SCTP, CU connects to AMF over NGAP, DU activates radio, UE connects to the RFsim server, performs SSB detection → PRACH → RRC setup → PDU session. The provided misconfiguration is gNB-side: misconfigured_param = "gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF". The `network_config` is summarized from logs: DU intends to connect F1-C to CU at 127.0.0.5, DU local F1-C is 127.0.0.3; DU serves NR band around 3619.2 MHz (NR band 48/78 per logs context). The UE expects the RFsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.

Key expectation: `gNBs.gNB_ID` must be a valid NR gNB ID consistent with 3GPP constraints (gNB ID length is configured and typically up to 32 bits, but in NGAP and OAI it is often limited to 22 bits when mapped to macro gNB ID). A value of 0xFFFFFFFF (32-bit all-ones) is out-of-range or invalid for the configured ID length and may be rejected or cause config parsing to fail.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Initialization confirms SA mode and CU identity strings:
  - "[GNB_APP] F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 0"
  - "[NGAP] Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 0"
- Immediately after initial setup, the CU asserts and exits:
  - Assertion failure: `config_isparamset(gnbParms, 0)` in `RCconfig_NR_CU_E1()`
  - Explicit message: "gNB_ID is not defined in configuration file" → CU treats the configured gNB_ID as invalid/unset.
  - File/line: `../../../openair2/E1AP/e1ap_setup.c:135` then "Exiting OAI softmodem: _Assert_Exit_".

Interpretation:
- The configuration file passed (`.../cu_case_180.conf`) contains `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (per misconfigured_param). OAI’s config validation likely rejects it (out-of-range for the selected gNBId length or fails conversion), resulting in CU concluding gNB_ID is not defined. Consequently, CU aborts before F1-C server is established and before NGAP to AMF proceeds beyond initial checks.

Cross-reference to network_config:
- NGAP and E1/E2 setup need a valid gNB ID. An invalid gNB ID will cause early abort in CU, consistent with the assert.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC and RRC cleanly, configures TDD patterns, frequencies, and prints:
  - ServingCellConfigCommon shows `PhysCellId 0`, `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz`.
  - F1AP configured: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5".
- Repeated SCTP connect failures:
  - "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused"
  - "[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying..." loops.
- DU waits: "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio".

Interpretation:
- DU is healthy but cannot connect to CU F1-C because CU exited due to the gNB_ID assert. Therefore, no SCTP server is listening on 127.0.0.5:the F1-C port. This is a downstream symptom of the CU failure.

Link to misconfiguration:
- F1-C handshake fails because CU is not running; root cause is the invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` value causing CU startup failure.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes RF/hw and attempts to connect to the RFsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Repeated failures: "connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)" (connection refused) in a loop.

Interpretation:
- In RFsim, the gNB process (commonly the DU instance with RFsim device) provides the server endpoint. Because DU defers radio activation until F1 Setup completes—and F1 cannot complete due to CU crash—the RFsim server side is not up. The UE’s repeated connection refusals are a cascading effect of the CU failure.

Link to network_config:
- UE appears configured correctly for frequency and RFsim client mode. The immediate blocker is lack of RFsim server due to DU being blocked by missing CU.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  1) CU aborts early with "gNB_ID is not defined" assertion (triggered by invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`).
  2) DU tries to open SCTP to CU and loops with "Connection refused" because CU is down.
  3) UE tries to connect to RFsim server (normally hosted by the gNB/DU) and gets connection refused since DU never activates radio without F1 Setup.

- Standards and OAI behavior:
  - In 3GPP, gNB ID is part of the NR Cell Global Identifier and is constrained by the gNB ID length (commonly 22 bits for macro gNB ID). A 32-bit all-ones value exceeds the permitted range when length is 22, and OAI configuration validators will reject it. Thus, the CU reports the gNB ID not set and aborts.

- Root cause:
  - Misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (invalid/out-of-range for configured gNB ID length) causes CU configuration validation to fail and terminate the process. This prevents F1-C setup and consequently blocks DU and UE operation.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Primary fix:
  - Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value consistent with the configured gNB ID length (e.g., 22-bit macro gNB ID). Safe examples: `0x000001`, `0x000010`, or align with deployment’s cell planning. Ensure uniqueness if multiple gNBs are present.
- After change:
  - Restart CU then DU. Verify CU no longer asserts, F1 Setup completes, DU activates radio, RFsim server becomes reachable, and UE can connect.
- Additional checks:
  - Confirm F1-C IPs match between CU and DU (logs show 127.0.0.5 for CU, 127.0.0.3 for DU), and ports are default/consistent.
  - Validate NGAP AMF IP configuration (CU logs parsed AMF IP 192.168.8.43; ensure reachability if running end-to-end core).

Corrected configuration snippets (embedded as JSON objects with comments to highlight changes):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001", // FIX: previously 0xFFFFFFFF (invalid for configured gNB ID length)
        "gNB_DU_name": "gNB-Eurecom-DU",
        "gNB_CU_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU"
      },
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_f1c_IPv4": "127.0.0.5", // as per DU target in logs
        "DU_f1c_IPv4": "127.0.0.3"  // DU local in logs; ensure CU listens on 127.0.0.5
      },
      "NGAP": {
        "amf_IPv4": "192.168.8.43" // as parsed by CU logs
      },
      "RFsim": {
        "enabled": true,
        "mode": "sa"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "dl_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "ssb_scs_khz": 30,
        "n_rb_dl": 106
      },
      "rfsimulator": {
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043 // UE repeatedly attempted this; keep consistent
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational verification steps:
- Start CU; confirm no assert. Look for NGAP connection attempts to AMF and F1-C listening socket.
- Start DU; confirm F1 Setup completes and radio activates.
- Start UE; confirm RFsim client connects, SSB detection occurs, and RRC Setup proceeds.


## 7. Limitations
- The provided JSON lacks an explicit full `network_config` object, so the corrected snippets are inferred from log evidence and typical OAI config structure.
- Logs are truncated (no timestamps and partial sequences), but the CU assert message conclusively indicates invalid/absent gNB_ID.
- The gNB ID length (e.g., 22 bits) is implementation-configured; the specific acceptable range may depend on other config fields. The recommendation uses a conservative, clearly in-range example (`0x000001`).
