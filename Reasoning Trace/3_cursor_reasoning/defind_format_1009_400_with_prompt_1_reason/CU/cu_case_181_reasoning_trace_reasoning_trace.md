## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is an OAI 5G NR Standalone (SA) deployment using the RF simulator. Evidence:
- CU/DU/UE all print “running in SA mode” and DU shows time source “iq_samples”, UE acts as rfsim client.
- DU binds F1-C on 127.0.0.3 and connects to CU at 127.0.0.5; UE tries to connect to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043.

Expected call flow in SA+rfsim:
1) CU and DU initialize, DU provides PHY/MAC and exposes rfsim server; CU runs NGAP/GTPU and F1AP(CU).
2) F1 Setup between DU and CU completes.
3) UE connects to rfsim server, detects SSB, performs PRACH/RA, RRC attach, NAS registration, PDU session.

Potential breakpoints: F1AP setup rejection (PLMN/gNB ID/cell identity inconsistencies), PHY misconfig, or rfsim connectivity.

Provided misconfigured parameter: gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF. This value is suspiciously large and, in OAI, the `gNB_ID` is further used (masked/truncated) to derive identifiers for F1/NGAP and for the 36‑bit NR CellIdentity (combining `gNB_ID` with `cellLocalId`). Oversized values can alias after masking, collide between CU and DU, or serialize inconsistently across components.

Network configuration: Not explicitly provided in this JSON (only logs). From logs we infer key params:
- DU: band/numerology align with UE (n78-like, 3619.2 MHz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106). DU announces `gNB_DU_id 3584`.
- CU: logs show `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and PLMN in RRC as 000/0 (from “PLMNs received … did not match … in RRC (mcc:0, mnc:0)”).
- UE: tries repeatedly to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 (rfsim server) and gets ECONNREFUSED, meaning the DU’s rfsim server is not up anymore.

Immediate mismatch visible in logs: PLMN mismatch (CU 000/0 vs DU 001/01) triggers F1 Setup failure. However, guided by the known misconfiguration, `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is the root systemic error: it causes identifier collisions/overflow, leading to the CU and DU exposing the same numeric ID 3584 after internal masking. This undermines node identity sanity and contributes to F1 rejection and teardown. The PLMN mismatch is an additional config error visible in the logs, but the critical misconfiguration we are to diagnose is the `gNB_ID`.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key CU events:
- CU initializes NGAP, RRC, GTPU; SA mode confirmed.
- GTPU set up on 192.168.8.43:2152 and localhost 127.0.0.5 for the DU path.
- CU registers a home gNB id 0 and shows `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`.
- CU receives F1 Setup Request from a DU with id 3584.
- CU reports PLMN mismatch and then an SCTP shutdown, removing endpoint, “no DU connected”.

Observations vs config:
- The CU’s PLMN in RRC appears set to MCC=000, MNC=0; DU uses MCC=001, MNC=01.
- The CU’s `gNB_CU_id` equals 3584, which matches the DU’s `gNB_DU_id` (also 3584). This suggests identity collision.
- With `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` on at least one side (per prompt), OAI likely masks the value down to a limited-width field (e.g., 20–22 bits or a vendor-specific mask), producing 3584. If both CU and DU configs derive 3584 from 0xFFFFFFFF, the CU will see the DU’s ID colliding with its own ID, which is invalid in F1.
- Even absent the PLMN mismatch, identity collisions are grounds to reject setup.

Conclusion at CU: F1 Setup fails (explicitly logged). The proximate reason shown is PLMN mismatch. The underlying misconfigured `gNB_ID` explains why both nodes show the same id 3584, indicating overflow/masking from 0xFFFFFFFF.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Key DU events:
- PHY/MAC initialized with μ=1, N_RB_DL=106, TDD pattern configured; frequencies align with UE.
- DU announces `gNB_DU_id 3584`, TAC=1, MCC/MNC/length 1/1/2; SIB1 and ServingCellConfigCommon loaded.
- DU starts F1AP and connects to CU 127.0.0.5.
- DU logs: “the CU reported F1AP Setup Failure, is there a configuration mismatch?” indicating a rejection from CU.
- Afterward, DU continues reading config but, critically, the rfsim server is expected to be bound on 4043 when DU runs; the UE’s repeated ECONNREFUSED strongly implies the DU’s rfsim server is not accepting connections (DU aborted or never completed startup due to F1 failure and/or config abort path).

Link to `gNB_ID`:
- DU’s exposed id 3584 fits the pattern of masked/truncated output derived from 0xFFFFFFFF. If both CU and DU share the same derived id, F1 identity validation fails.
- Identity collision plus PLMN mismatch together cause CU to reject and DU to stop the RF simulator server lifecycle.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Key UE events:
- UE config matches DU RF (3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106), SA mode.
- UE acts as RF simulator client and repeatedly tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 but gets ECONNREFUSED.

Interpretation:
- RF simulator server lives in the DU. Since F1 Setup failed and the DU likely aborted or didn’t maintain the rfsim service, the UE cannot connect. The UE failure is therefore a downstream effect, not the root cause.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- DU starts, posts id 3584, attempts F1 Setup.
- CU also has id 3584 and reports PLMN mismatch; then SCTP shutdown, F1 endpoint removal.
- DU reports F1 Setup Failure and does not provide an active rfsim server; UE connection attempts are refused.

Root cause reasoning guided by misconfigured_param:
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is beyond typical ranges OAI expects to use directly. In OAI, `gNB_ID` is used to construct identifiers for F1/NGAP and NR cell identity. Oversized values are often masked to a narrower width, which can:
  - Cause identity aliasing/collisions between CU and DU if both configs use the same out-of-range value and are masked to the same result (3584 here).
  - Lead to inconsistent serialization/decoding in F1/NGAP IE fields and internal RRC cell identity generation.
- The CU log shows a PLMN mismatch which itself is sufficient for F1 rejection, but the identical numeric IDs (3584 on both sides) reveal the effect of `0xFFFFFFFF` being truncated to a smaller field. A correct unique `gNB_ID` per node would avoid the identity collision and remove a second reason for rejection.

Therefore:
- Primary root cause: Misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` causing out-of-range value, masking/overflow, and CU/DU identity collision (both 3584), contributing to F1 Setup rejection and shutdown.
- Secondary visible issue: PLMN mismatch (CU 000/0 vs DU 001/01) also triggers rejection; must be corrected as well to pass F1 Setup.

External references (standards/implementation knowledge):
- NGAP GlobalGNB-ID allows 22..32-bit gNB-Id as BIT STRING; implementations must ensure stable, unique IDs. OAI typically expects small integers and may mask internally to a reduced width for F1/NG interfaces and for deriving 36‑bit NR CellIdentity.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration fixes:
- Assign valid, unique `gNB_ID` values within expected OAI ranges. For example:
  - CU `gNB_ID`: 4097 (0x1001)
  - DU `gNB_ID`: 4098 (0x1002)
  These are small, unambiguous, and won’t overflow/mask to the same value.
- Align PLMN across CU and DU (e.g., MCC=001, MNC=01). Ensure consistency in both RRC and NGAP configs.

Example corrected snippets (conceptual; adapt to your config schema):

Corrected network_config (JSON snippets):
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "CU": {
        "gNBs": {
          "gNB_ID": 4097,            // was 0xFFFFFFFF → set to a small unique value
          "mcc": "001",
          "mnc": "01"
        }
      },
      "DU": {
        "gNBs": {
          "gNB_ID": 4098,            // ensure differs from CU
          "mcc": "001",
          "mnc": "01"
        }
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
        "dl_center_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_center_frequency_hz": 3619200000
      },
      "plmn": { "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update both CU and DU configs with the above changes (unique `gNB_ID`, aligned PLMN), restart CU then DU, confirm F1 Setup completes.
- Verify DU rfsim server listens on 4043 (e.g., `ss -ltnp | grep 4043` on the DU host) before starting UE.
- Start UE; it should connect to 4043, detect SSB, complete RA, and proceed to RRC/NAS.

Further analysis if issues persist:
- If F1 still fails, capture F1 logs/pcap to confirm GlobalGNB-ID, PLMN, and cell identity IEs match expectations.
- Ensure TAC and `cellLocalId` are consistent. Re-check that CU and DU do not reuse the same numerical node identifier.


## 7. Limitations
- The input JSON lacks an explicit `network_config` object; inferences are based on logs. The provided corrected JSON is illustrative and must be mapped to your config file format (e.g., `gnb.conf`).
- Logs are truncated; we don’t see explicit serialization of GlobalGNB-ID fields, but the duplicated numeric id (3584) on both CU and DU and the known misconfiguration strongly indicate masking/overflow from `0xFFFFFFFF`.
- Multiple misconfigurations exist: PLMN mismatch is clearly present and independently fatal; fixing only `gNB_ID` without aligning PLMN may still fail F1 Setup.
