## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- **Scenario**: OAI 5G NR Standalone with `--rfsim` (RF simulator). Components: CU, DU, UE. Expected bring-up: initialize → F1-C between DU↔CU and NGAP between CU↔AMF → DU radio activation → UE sync/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- **Misconfigured parameter (given)**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- **First-order expectations about `gNB_ID`**:
  - In NG-RAN, `gNB_ID` is a bit string of constrained length. Implementations (incl. OAI) typically constrain usable `gNB_ID` to 22 bits for gNB (max `0x3FFFFF`). `0xFFFFFFFF` is out of range and often triggers config parsing/validation failures.
- **Initial network_config read**: The JSON only exposes the misconfigured `gNB_ID`; other `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` details are implicit from logs:
  - DL/UL center frequency ~3.6192 GHz (band 48/78 depending on mapping in logs), numerology µ=1, `N_RB_DL=106`, TDD pattern present.
  - DU targets F1-C to CU at `127.0.0.5`, binds GTP-U `127.0.0.3`.
  - UE tries RFsim at `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets connection refused.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- [LIBCONFIG] syntax error at CU config line 31 → config module not loaded → "init aborted". Command line shows `--rfsim --sa -O .../cu_case_85.conf`.
- No NGAP/F1 startup occurs because config fails very early.
- Likely culprit at or before line 31: invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (out-of-range literal) causing libconfig parse/validation to error. In OAI, such invalid values surface as libconfig parse errors or downstream validation failures that abort init.
- Result: CU process does not start F1-C SCTP server on `127.0.0.5`.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC and computes TDD mapping; sets DL/UL freqs to 3619200000 Hz, µ=1, `N_RB=106`.
- F1AP client attempts to connect: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5".
- Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and F1AP retries; DU remains in "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" state. This means DU never receives F1 SETUP RESPONSE (CU-side not up), so radio never activates and RU threads remain idle for UE-facing service.
- No PRACH or UE activity can proceed without F1 established and CU-driven activation.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE config aligns with DU: µ=1, `N_RB_DL=106`, TDD, DL/UL at 3619200000 Hz.
- UE acts as RFsim client and repeatedly tries `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)` (connection refused). In RFsim, server side is provided by the gNB stack (DU/CU depending on split). Because DU is blocked waiting for F1 setup and CU failed to start, the RFsim server endpoint is not listening → UE cannot connect.
- No evidence of PRACH attempts because the RFsim transport never establishes.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- CU fails at configuration parsing → CU never starts F1-C server (and NGAP) → DU F1 client sees connection refused and never activates radio → RFsim server not listening → UE client gets connection refused at 127.0.0.1:4043.
- The provided misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` explains the CU parse failure: value exceeds typical OAI-accepted gNB ID range (22-bit max `0x3FFFFF`). This single invalid field at or near line 31 is sufficient to abort the CU and cascade failures across DU and UE.
- Therefore, the root cause is the invalid `gNB_ID` value in `gnb.conf` leading to CU non-initialization and subsequent F1/RFsim unavailability.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- **Fix the misconfiguration**: choose a valid 22-bit `gNB_ID` (example `0x000001`). Ensure the field is under the correct path `gNBs.gNB_ID` and formatted per libconfig expectations.
- **Re-validate CU bring-up**: after correction, CU should parse config, start NGAP/F1, and accept DU F1 setup; DU will activate radio; RFsim server will listen; UE should then connect and proceed to sync and RRC attach.
- **Double-check addressing**: confirm CU F1-C listen IP/port matches DU connect target (`127.0.0.5` from logs) and that RFsim endpoints are consistent. Keep frequency and TDD settings aligned with UE.

Corrected snippets (expressed as JSON-like for clarity):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001" // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a valid 22-bit ID (<= 0x3FFFFF)
      }
      // ... other existing gNB config unchanged ...
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change required based on given logs; UE RFsim connection failure was a consequence of CU/DU state.
      // Ensure RFsim server addr/port remain consistent with gNB (127.0.0.1:4043 in this setup).
    }
  }
}
```

- **Operational checks after fix**:
  - CU logs: no libconfig errors; NGAP connects to AMF; F1-C server listening.
  - DU logs: F1 Setup Response received; radio activated; no more SCTP connection refused.
  - UE logs: RFsim connects; UE syncs to SSB; PRACH occurs; RRC Setup completes.


## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not include the exact CU config line content, but the misconfigured parameter is explicitly provided and explains the observed cascade.
- Exact permitted `gNB_ID` bit-length can vary by implementation; OAI commonly enforces 22-bit for gNB. Any value within that bound (e.g., small decimal or hex ≤ `0x3FFFFF`) is safe.
- Other configuration fields (e.g., AMF IP, PLMN, TAC) were not shown in the JSON; if issues persist after this fix, inspect those as next steps.
