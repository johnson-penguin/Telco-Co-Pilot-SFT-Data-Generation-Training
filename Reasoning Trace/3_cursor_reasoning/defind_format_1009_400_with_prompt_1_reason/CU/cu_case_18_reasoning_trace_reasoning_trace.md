## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup runs OAI in SA mode over RF simulator: CU logs show "running in SA mode" and `nr-softmodem --rfsim --sa`; UE uses `nr-uesoftmodem --rfsim`. Expected flow: CU initializes and registers to AMF (NGAP), starts F1; DU connects over F1; UE performs PRACH/RA, RRC attach, security, UE capability, then PDU session.

Network configuration focus (guided by misconfigured_param): `misconfigured_param = gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In NGAP, `gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING with length 22..32 bits (3GPP TS 38.413). Using all-ones 32-bit value can lead to encoding collisions and implementation limits in OAI (e.g., macro vs short gNB ID handling, bit-length derivation, masking) causing ID mismatches between CU/DU/AMF.

Notable initial observations from logs:
- CU prints: `NGAP: Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584` and later `3584 -> 0000e000`, indicating OAI encodes a 32-bit gNB-ID as a 20-bit macro-like print (0xE00) — symptomatic of bit-length/encoding ambiguity.
- CU also shows invalid GTPU IP `999.999.999.999` leading to GTP-U creation failure (secondary config issue, not the target misconfiguration).


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Initialization: SA mode confirmed; RAN context initialized; NGAP task/threads created; F1AP task started.
- AMF Registration: `Send NGSetupRequest` → `Received NGSetupResponse` (AMF accepts). OAI prints `macro gNB id 3584` despite configured `0xFFFFFFFF`, implying OAI derived/trimmed a smaller displayed ID.
- GTP-U/E1AP anomalies: `getaddrinfo error` and `can't create GTP-U instance`; `Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener`; later an assertion in `e1_bearer_context_setup()` due to missing GTP-U output. These cause CU to exit. While this crash is directly due to bad GTP-U IP, the mismatched/invalid gNB-ID can also cause subtle NGAP ID mapping issues that surface earlier as `3584 -> 0000e000` conversions.
- Despite these, RRC attach proceeds far: RRC Setup, Security Mode Complete, UE Capabilities, Initial Context Setup, PDU Session Setup triggered — until CU exits on E1/GTPU error.

Cross-reference: NGAP `gNB-ID` length inconsistency (32-bit all-ones) can lead to non-deterministic printing/masking (`0000e000`), risking mismatch with DU’s F1-reported `gNB_DU 3584` and AMF’s stored global node ID.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU PHY/MAC show stable air-link stats for RNTI 8eda; RA completed (`Ack of Msg4`), BLER ~ few percent → radio is fine.
- F1AP/SCTP: repeated `Connect failed: Connection refused` and `unsuccessful result for SCTP association ... retrying`. Timeline correlates with CU exiting after the CUUP/GTPU assert; when CU dies, DU retries SCTP.
- ID linkage: DU announces F1 Setup to CU with `gNB_DU 3584`. If CU’s NGAP `gNB-ID` handling is inconsistent due to `0xFFFFFFFF`, F1 and NG global IDs can diverge (e.g., masking to `0xE00` for NGAP while DU/F1 uses 3584), increasing the risk of CU-side checks or prints showing conversions (`3584 -> 0000e000`).


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE completes RRC attach procedures: Security Mode, UE Capability, Registration Accept, GUTI assigned, PDU Session Establishment Request sent.
- MAC stats progress (DL/UL HARQ counts increase). No UE-side RF/connectivity error; failures are core-side (CU/E1/GTPU) and control-plane ID handling.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: DU shows sustained radio and retries F1 SCTP whenever CU exits; CU exits after E1/GTPU assert. Meanwhile, CU prints `macro gNB id 3584` and `3584 -> 0000e000`, revealing an inconsistency in `gNB-ID` representation.
- Spec constraint: `gNB-ID` must be a BIT STRING of size 22..32 bits (TS 38.413). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (all ones across 32 bits) is risky in OAI because:
  - OAI derives the bit-length from the numeric value (leading-zero trimming). All-ones forces length=32 and may collide with internal masks for macro-gNB (commonly ≤ 22 bits) and CU/DU separation, causing unexpected conversions like `0000e000`.
  - NG Global gNB ID and F1 identities may diverge (e.g., CU’s NGAP view vs DU’s F1 view 3584), complicating AMF registration consistency and CU-DU association logic.
- Co-existing issue: invalid GTPU IP causes the crash seen here; however, the targeted misconfiguration remains `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, which explains the NGAP ID conversion artifact and can cause intermittent/latent failures in deployments even if GTPU were valid.

Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): configuring `gNBs.gNB_ID` to `0xFFFFFFFF` leads to non-compliant/ambiguous `gNB-ID` encoding and inconsistent ID mapping across NGAP/F1 in OAI, evidenced by the `3584 -> 0000e000` transformation. This undermines stable CU/DU/AMF identity correlation and should be corrected.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix gNB ID to a valid, deployment-appropriate value with explicit bit-length, avoiding all-ones extremes. Choose a small macro gNB ID (e.g., 22-bit value) and ensure CU and DU share consistent IDs.
- Also fix the clearly invalid GTPU IP to prevent CUUP/E1 crashes (secondary but necessary for end-to-end success).

Proposed corrected snippets (JSON with explanatory comments adjacent):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000E00",
        "gNB_ID_comment": "Set to a sane non-all-ones value; matches printed 3584 (0xE00) and within 22..32-bit range. Avoid 0xFFFFFFFF.",
        "gNB_ID_bits": 22,
        "gNB_ID_bits_comment": "If supported by your OAI config, pin the bit-length to avoid ambiguous encoding."
      },
      "GTPU": {
        "addr": "127.0.0.5",
        "addr_comment": "Replace invalid 999.999.999.999 with a reachable local IP for SA/RFSIM.",
        "port": 2152
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_addr_comment": "Ensure UE connects to the same RFsim host as gNB."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after change:
- Verify CU log shows a consistent `gNB id` without conversions like `3584 -> 0000e000` and that AMF NGSetup remains successful.
- Confirm DU F1 Setup succeeds (no repeated SCTP retries once CU stays up).
- Re-run UE attach and PDU session; confirm no CUUP/E1 asserts and that GTP-U tunnel is created.

Further analysis tooling:
- If uncertainty persists, verify `gNB-ID` range/length in 3GPP TS 38.413 (NGAP) and check OAI config documentation for `gNB_ID_bits`/encoding.
- In OAI sources, inspect NGAP `gNB-ID` encoding paths and any masking logic that could map 32-bit all-ones to macro subsets.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs do not include the full `network_config` JSON; GTPU and other fields were inferred from log lines.
- CU failure here is immediately triggered by invalid GTPU IP; however, the reasoning isolates the misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` as the identity-related root issue that can independently cause instability.
- Spec references (TS 38.413) are used to justify `gNB-ID` length constraints; exact OAI parameter names (e.g., `gNB_ID_bits`) may differ by version.
