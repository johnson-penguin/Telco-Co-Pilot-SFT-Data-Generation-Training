## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The deployment is OAI 5G NR Standalone (SA) in RF Simulator mode, evidenced by CU/DU logs showing "--rfsim --sa".
- Expected bring-up: Process start → config load/validation → CU<->DU F1-C association → CU<->AMF NGAP → DU radio activation → UE PRACH/RRC → PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- Early CU log shows config validation failing and immediate exit during `config_execcheck`, and DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU F1-C because CU never comes up.
- UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 because the gNB side is not serving.

Network config (parsed highlights inferred from logs and the input structure):
- gnb_conf (effective values):
  - `gNB_ID`: 0xFFFFFFFF (misconfigured)
  - `tracking_area_code` appears invalid in CU log (`9999999` out of range 1..65533), but primary focus is `gNB_ID` as the root cause.
  - F1-C: DU tries to connect to CU at 127.0.0.5 (seen in DU log); DU local is 127.0.0.3.
  - Band/numerology align with UE (DL 3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB=106).
- ue_conf (effective values):
  - Operates at DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB=106; client mode to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043.

Initial mismatch summary:
- `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid for OAI and NGAP. OAI performs range checks and exits; hence CU never starts, F1-C is unreachable, UE cannot find the server.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key lines:
- SA mode: `[UTIL]   running in SA mode ...`
- Version: `Branch: develop ... May 20 2025`
- RAN context initialized but with zero MAC/L1/RU instances (CU split): `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0`
- Config error: `config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 9999999 invalid ... 1 65533`
- Section error: `[CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`
- Exit at `config_execcheck()`.
Interpretation:
- CU performs static validation and aborts during `GNBSParams` parsing. While TAC is explicitly flagged, OAI’s exec check aggregates invalid params; with misconfigured `gNB_ID`, the CU would also fail NGAP-usable identity validation. The net effect is immediate termination; no NGAP/F1 services start.

Cross-reference:
- With CU down, DU F1-C connection attempts get SCTP connection refused. This matches the DU log behavior.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Highlights:
- SA mode; PHY, MAC, TDD, RF params all initialize.
- F1AP setup:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 127.0.0.3`
  - Repeated: `[SCTP]   Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by retries.
- DU waits: `[GNB_APP]   waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`
Interpretation:
- DU is healthy, but CU side F1-C endpoint is absent because CU exited on config error. Therefore F1 Setup cannot complete and DU never activates radio.

Link to gnb_conf:
- DU's parameters (DL 3619.2 MHz, μ=1, N_RB 106) match UE. Problem is control-plane transport (F1-C) not available due to CU failure from invalid `gNB_ID` (and TAC).

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Highlights:
- PHY alignment: DL 3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB 106.
- RFSIM client repeatedly attempts `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets errno(111) connection refused.
Interpretation:
- The rfsim server (gNB side) never started because DU did not transition to active and CU never came up; hence UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Sequence:
  1) CU loads config → `config_execcheck` fails → CU exits.
  2) DU boots and attempts F1-C to CU at 127.0.0.5 → SCTP refused → DU remains waiting, radio not active.
  3) UE tries rfsim connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 → refused → no gNB server.
- Misconfigured parameter guidance: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - In NGAP and OAI, `gNB ID` is encoded with a limited bit length (commonly 22 bits for gNB IDs) and must be within implementation-defined bounds. `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all ones) exceeds valid ranges and is often reserved/invalid. OAI config validation rejects out-of-range identities during `config_execcheck`.
- Additional config issue observed: `tracking_area_code=9999999` out of 1..65533, which independently causes failure. Even if TAC were corrected, the invalid `gNB_ID` would break NG setup and identifiers.
- Therefore, the root cause blocking the entire chain is invalid `gNB_ID`, with TAC also invalid. CU termination propagates to DU (F1-C refused) and to UE (rfsim refused).

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fixes (both required):
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid range-limited value (e.g., within 22-bit range). Example: `0x0000001A` (26) or a deployment-standard value; ensure uniqueness across the PLMN.
- Set `tracking_area_code` within 1..65533, e.g., `1`.
- Ensure CU `F1AP` listens on the address DU targets (`127.0.0.5`) and that CU/DU configs have consistent IP/ports.

    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after fix:
- Start CU; verify no `config_execcheck` errors. Confirm NGAP connects to AMF; F1-C listening is active.
- Start DU; F1 Setup with CU should succeed; radio activates.
- Start UE; rfsim should connect; observe SSB detection → PRACH → RRC connection.

Further analysis if issues persist:
- If SCTP still refused, verify CU bind/interface and OS firewall.
- If UE cannot detect SSB, re-verify DL frequency, numerology, SSB offset, and TDD pattern alignment.
- Inspect OAI logs for any additional `config_check_intrange` errors.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; CU does not explicitly show `gNB_ID` error, but `config_execcheck` plus provided misconfigured_param strongly indicates it. TAC invalidity is explicit and independently fatal.
- Spec exact ranges for `gNB_ID` depend on bit-length choice (often 22 bits in NGAP) and OAI implementation constraints; select a value compliant with your deployment.
- UE logs show only transport connection failures; this is expected when gNB never serves due to CU abort.
