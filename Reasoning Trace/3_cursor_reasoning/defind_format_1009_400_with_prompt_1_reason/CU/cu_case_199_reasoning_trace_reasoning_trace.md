## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- SA mode with OAI `nr-softmodem` components for CU, DU, and UE. CU/DU are started with F1 split; UE uses `rfsimulator` and tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.
- Expected flow: CU initializes → NGAP setup to AMF → CU starts F1AP listener → DU connects via SCTP to CU (F1-C) → DU becomes active and starts radio → UE connects to rfsim server (DU) → SSB/PRACH/RRC → Registration/PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter (guiding prior): `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (an invalid/overflowing gNB ID value for OAI/NGAP/F1 usage). A valid 5G gNB ID is at most 32 bits total with a gNB ID field of up to 28 bits per TS 38.413/23.003; `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits all ones) often maps to -1 or reserved and can break ID handling.
- Immediate symptom across logs: CU crashes during F1 listener creation due to name resolution failure for `abc.def.ghi.jkl` and subsequent GTPU instance assert; DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect (connection refused); UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server (no DU radio) → chain reaction from CU not standing up F1-C.

Assumed network_config summary (from provided JSON context):
- gnb_conf key params likely include: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, F1-C CU addr (string wrongly set as `abc.def.ghi.jkl`), DU F1-C target 127.0.0.5, DU local 127.0.0.3, NG AMF 192.168.8.43, GTP-U 2152, band/numerology consistent with B78, DL/UL 3619 MHz.
- ue_conf key params: rfsimulator server `127.0.0.1:4043`, numerology 1, N_RB 106 (matches DU/gnb). No SIM/PLMN anomalies visible in logs.

Initial mismatches noted:
- CU tries to bind GTPU/F1 on `abc.def.ghi.jkl` (invalid hostname) → immediate failure. This is separate but co-occurs with the misconfigured gNB ID.
- Misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` can corrupt NGAP and F1AP identifiers (e.g., macro ID derivations), influencing messages like "Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584"; however logs show 3584 used elsewhere, indicating OAI also derives a local ID, but the invalid configured ID may still poison SCTP/F1 setup or RRC cell identity encoding.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU initializes in SA; NGAP to AMF succeeds: sends NGSetupRequest and receives NGSetupResponse → AMF OK.
- CU spins up F1AP task and attempts SCTP listener: `F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for abc.def.ghi.jkl len 16`.
- GTPU attempts to init on `abc.def.ghi.jkl:2152`; `getaddrinfo error: Name or service not known` → assertion at `sctp_create_new_listener()` and failure to create CU F1-U UDP listener; process exits with `_Assert_Exit_` from SCTP and F1AP tasks.
- Notable: Prior to crash, CU printed `NGAP 3584 -> 0000e000`, and "Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584" (macro id looks small and valid). That suggests some internal derivation independent of configured `gNBs.gNB_ID`. But the configured invalid ID can still surface in other layers (e.g., F1 node identifiers, cell identity fields in RRC SIB1) and is not guaranteed to be masked everywhere.
- Cross-ref config: CU address/hostname for F1/GTP should be a valid IP (e.g., 127.0.0.5). The invalid hostname is a deterministic immediate crash reason. The misconfigured gNB ID is a latent protocol-level issue likely to cause interop/asserts later if CU address were fixed.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU PHY/MAC initializes correctly; band 48 in log line, but absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz aligns with B78; numerology 1, N_RB 106. TDD config printed and consistent.
- F1AP: DU attempts SCTP connect to CU 127.0.0.5 from 127.0.0.3; repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and F1AP retries. This matches CU not listening due to its crash.
- The DU is thus blocked waiting for F1 Setup Response and never activates radio ("waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio"). No PRACH/MAC errors otherwise.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE HW/PHY initializes with DL/UL 3619 MHz, numerology 1, N_RB 106; attempts to connect to rfsimulator server 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly; all attempts fail errno 111 (connection refused). This is because DU never became rfsim server as it waits for F1 setup; CU crash prevents F1.
- No RRC procedures observed (no SSB found, no PRACH) due to no gNB active.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation: CU exits after failing to resolve/ bind `abc.def.ghi.jkl` → DU cannot connect F1 (connection refused) → UE cannot connect to rfsim server, looping.
- Guided by misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid in OAI. 5G `gNB-ID` is at most 24..32 bits depending on PLMN and NR Cell Identity composition; all-ones often represents an uninitialized or reserved value. In OAI, `gNBs.gNB_ID` participates in NGAP/F1AP node IDs and RRC NR CellIdentity derivations. Using 0xFFFFFFFF risks overflow/negative conversions, wrong bit-masking, or non-compliant IDs in ASN.1 encoders, which can lead to setup failures or asserts (commonly during NGSetup, F1Setup, or SIB1 encoding). In these logs, NGAP succeeds likely because OAI overrides with a computed macro id 3584, but the configuration remains incorrect and dangerous.
- Immediate blocker in logs is the invalid CU hostname/IP for F1/GTP leading to CU crash. However, even after fixing hostname, the misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` can still break downstream procedures (e.g., F1Setup gNB-DU ID exchange, RRC SIB1 cell identity). Therefore, both issues should be fixed.

Root-cause statement: The network config includes an invalid gNB identifier `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` that violates allowed ranges for OAI/3GPP node identities, and the CU also uses an invalid F1/GTP bind address (`abc.def.ghi.jkl`). The CU crash is triggered by the bad address; the misconfigured gNB ID is the primary misconfiguration highlighted and must be corrected to ensure standards-compliant operation once the CU address is fixed.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix 1 (critical to avoid crash): Set CU F1/GTP bind IP/hostname to a valid address that matches DU’s expected CU address, e.g., `127.0.0.5`.
- Fix 2 (per misconfigured_param): Change `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value, e.g., a 22–28-bit gNB ID consistent with NR CellIdentity planning. Common OAI examples use small integers like `3584` or `0x00000E00`. Ensure consistency with `nr_cellid`/`nci` if specified.
- Validate NGAP/F1AP after changes: CU should send NGSetup, stand up F1 listener; DU should complete F1 Setup; DU activates radio; UE should connect to rfsim.
- Optional checks: Verify SIB1 `cellIdentity` encoding, and that `trackingAreaCode`, `PLMN`, and `NRARFCN` match UE.

      }
    }
  }
}
```

Additional debug steps:
- Re-run CU; confirm `F1AP CU listening on 127.0.0.5` and no `getaddrinfo` errors.
- DU should complete `F1 Setup Response` and print radio activation. UE should then connect to rfsim server successfully.
- If any NGAP/F1AP ID-related errors appear, re-check `gNB_ID` bit-length and cell identity mapping.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not include the explicit `network_config` JSON; assumed fields are based on observed strings. The UE/CU configs may include additional parameters not shown.
- The immediate CU crash is definitively due to invalid hostname. The misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is identified as non-compliant and risky; while not the direct cause of the shown crash, it is a root configuration error that should be corrected to avoid protocol-level failures once the listener binds.
- Specification bases: 3GPP TS 23.003 (identities), TS 38.413 (NGAP node identifiers), TS 38.331/38.211 (RRC/PHY cell identity composition). No external tool was invoked here; conclusions rely on typical OAI behavior and 3GPP constraints.
