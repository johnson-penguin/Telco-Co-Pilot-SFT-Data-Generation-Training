## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The scenario is OAI 5G NR SA with rfsim: CU/DU/UE all show SA mode and rfsimulator usage. Expected flow: process configs → initialize CU/DU → F1-C SCTP association → NGAP to AMF (for CU) → DU radio activation → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB/PBCH decode → PRACH → RRC → PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured_param is **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**. In NR, the gNB-ID used in NG-RAN identifiers is limited by 3GPP to at most 32 bits, with the gNB-ID length typically 22–32 bits selected per cell identity sizing; OAI commonly constrains this via config parsing (e.g., ≤ 22 bits when combined with cell ID bits). Value `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) exceeds common OAI/ASN.1 constraints for gNB-ID length and can overflow or be rejected.
- Network configuration (gnb_conf/ue_conf) is to be parsed for identifiers, SCTP/F1 addressing, frequencies, TDD, and IDs. From logs we infer:
  - DU frequency plan: DL/UL 3619200000 Hz (n48/n78 region depending on mapping, DU says DLBand 78 and absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz).
  - CU/DU F1 IDs printed: CU shows `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`; DU shows `gNB_DU_id 3584` and `cellID 1`.
  - UE attempts rfsim connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` but fails repeatedly (connection refused), implying no server on that port—typically DU radio server would listen after activation.
- Early mismatch hints:
  - CU log reports a config error: bad `drb_ciphering` value `invalid_enum_value` (only yes/no allowed). This would already break CU config parsing.
  - The specified misconfigured gNB ID (`0xFFFFFFFF`) would further break CU’s identity encoding and likely prevent F1/NGAP stack initialization.

Conclusion upfront: CU fails to initialize F1/NGAP due to invalid configuration (notably the out-of-range `gNBs.gNB_ID`, plus an invalid `drb_ciphering`), so DU’s SCTP to CU is refused; without F1 Setup, DU never activates radio/rfsim server; UE can’t connect to rfsim and loops on connection refused.

---

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU starts in SA mode, prints build info, and RAN context with no L1/RU (as expected for CU):
  - `[GNB_APP] Initialized RAN Context: RC.nb_nr_inst = 1, ... RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0, RC.nb_RU = 0`
- Shows CU identifiers:
  - `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`. The printed CU id (3584 = 0xE00) suggests the configured `gNBs.gNB_ID` was sanitized/clamped internally or another default path was taken. However, right after, a configuration error is reported:
  - `[RRC] in configuration file, bad drb_ciphering value 'invalid_enum_value', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed`
- Config parse proceeds reading sections (`GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, etc.), but crucially there is no subsequent evidence of:
  - NGAP setup (no AMF connection logs)
  - F1AP server listening at CU (no `Starting F1AP at CU` or SCTP server ready)
- Given both the invalid `drb_ciphering` and the misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID`, CU likely failed to fully apply RRC config and/or to initialize F1/NGAP, leaving no SCTP listener for the DU.
- Cross-reference to network config:
  - F1-C CU IP expected by DU is `127.0.0.5` (see DU logs). No CU-side confirmation of binding/listening appears. This aligns with DU’s repeated SCTP connection refused.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 successfully: antenna ports, TDD config, frequencies (DL=UL=3619200000), numerology μ=1, N_RB=106, SIB1 parameters parsed.
- DU F1AP side:
  - `F1AP: gNB_DU_id 3584, gNB_DU_name gNB-Eurecom-DU, TAC 1 ... cellID 1`
  - `F1AP] Starting F1AP at DU`
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` → attempts active SCTP connect to CU.
  - Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by `F1AP ... retrying...`
- DU app says `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → radio not activated → rfsim server not started.
- No PRACH/PHY runtime beyond initialization due to lack of F1 Setup; thus UE cannot proceed.
- Link to gNB ID:
  - DU’s own `gNB_DU_id 3584` is consistent with CU’s printed `gNB_CU_id 3584`, but CU likely failed earlier due to invalid gNB ID in global config and invalid `drb_ciphering`, so DU’s attempts are refused at TCP/SCTP layer.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY consistent with DU: μ=1, N_RB=106, DL freq 3619200000 Hz, TDD mode.
- UE runs as rfsim client, repeatedly trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, always getting `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- This is expected because DU didn’t activate radio (blocked by missing F1 Setup), so the rfsim server (DU side) isn’t listening.
- No SSB/PBCH/PRACH attempts appear, as UE cannot even connect to the RF simulator server.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU fails to complete configuration and does not start F1/NGAP → there is no SCTP server on CU.
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (`connection refused`) → F1 Setup never completes → DU radio not activated → rfsim server not started.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server → repeated connect failures.
- Given the provided root clue `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`:
  - 3GPP identifiers: gNB-ID length is configured between 22 and 32 bits (TS 38.413/38.473 and NR-RRC composition with NR CellIdentity). OAI often expects values that fit within configured length; overly large values can trip ASN.1 encoding or internal bitfield checks.
  - `0xFFFFFFFF` likely exceeds the allowed length (for example, if OAI selects a gNB-ID length of 22 bits for cell identity composition, the maximum would be `(1<<22)-1 = 4194303`, far less than 4294967295). This mismatch can lead to config validation failure or incorrect masking/clamping that invalidates subsequent identity-dependent initializations (F1/NGAP node identity, PLMN+gNB ID encoding).
  - The CU log’s separate `drb_ciphering` error confirms the configuration is invalid; combined with an out-of-range gNB ID, CU plausibly aborts starting F1/NGAP server.

Root cause: The CU configuration contains an invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` (`0xFFFFFFFF`) that violates OAI’s accepted gNB-ID size for the chosen gNB-ID length, preventing proper identity setup and F1/NGAP initialization. The DU/UE failures are cascading effects.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix the identity parameter:
  - Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a value within the allowed bit-length. Safe choices: a small non-zero value or the value already echoed by logs (3584 = `0x00000E00`).
  - Ensure the configured gNB-ID length (if present in config) matches the intended ID size; otherwise rely on OAI defaults and keep the ID within 22 bits: max `0x3FFFFF` (4194303).
- Fix other config errors surfaced by logs:
  - Change `drb_ciphering` to `yes` or `no`.
- After changes, expected behavior:
  - CU should start F1/NGAP servers, DU should succeed SCTP association and complete F1 Setup, DU will activate radio/rfsim server, and UE will connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and proceed to SSB/PBCH/PRACH.
- Suggested corrected config snippets embedded inside `network_config` structure (JSON with comments for clarity):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        // Changed to a valid 22-bit value (decimal 3584 = 0x00000E00)
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000E00",
        // If your config has a separate gNB ID length parameter, ensure consistency (e.g., 22)
        "gNB_ID_length": 22
      },
      "RRC": {
        // Fixed invalid enum
        "drb_ciphering": "yes"
      },
      "F1AP": {
        // Ensure CU binds and matches DU expectations
        "CU_F1C_bind_addr": "127.0.0.5",
        "DU_F1C_peer_allow": ["127.0.0.3"]
      },
      "SCTP": {
        "CU_port": 38472
      },
      "NGAP": {
        // Example; ensure AMF IP/PLMN configured as per your setup
        "AMF_addr": "127.0.0.18",
        "PLMN": { "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" }
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        // No change needed for frequency per logs
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ssb_subcarrier_spacing_khz": 30,
        "N_RB_DL": 106
      },
      "rfsimulator": {
        // DU will listen here after F1 Setup → radio activation
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Operational validation steps:
  - Start CU and verify logs show F1/NGAP servers listening; no config errors.
  - Start DU, confirm SCTP association established and `F1 Setup Response` received; radio activated, rfsim server started.
  - Start UE, ensure successful connection to rfsim server, SSB sync, PRACH, RRC connection.
- If issues persist, check:
  - Any remaining out-of-range identifiers (NR CellIdentity composition).
  - PLMN mismatch between CU broadcast and UE.
  - F1-C addressing: DU’s `connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` must match CU bind.

---

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated (no CU F1/NGAP startup lines), and the actual `network_config` JSON content was not fully provided; fixes above are inferred from logs and the declared misconfigured parameter.
- Another explicit error (`drb_ciphering` invalid) exists; while the focus here is `gNBs.gNB_ID`, both must be corrected for a clean bring-up.
- 3GPP references: gNB-ID sizing relates to TS 38.413/38.473 and NR-RRC identities; OAI implementation may impose stricter limits depending on cell identity composition. If unsure, consult OAI docs/source for `gNB_ID` constraints and acceptable ranges.
