## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs indicate a Standalone (SA) 5G NR deployment using OAI with RF Simulator (`--rfsim --sa`). Expected bring-up flow: initialize CU/DU/UE → F1AP association (DU↔CU) → NGAP association (CU↔AMF) → DU activates radio → UE connects to RFsim server → RACH/PRACH → RRC setup → PDU session.

Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (all-ones 32-bit). In NGAP, the gNB-ID is a bit string with allowed sizes between 22 and 32 bits configured consistently, and practical values must be within the selected size and not exceed network/operator allocations. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` creates boundary/overflow/validation risks in NGAP identities and may lead to encoding/decoding failures, mismatched macro gNB ID derivations, or setup rejection.

Network config (from gnb_conf/ue_conf as implied by logs):
- CU: shows `gNB_CU_id 3584`, GTP-U local `192.168.8.43:2152`, NGAP AMF IP parsed as `999.999.999.999` (invalid). F1-C CU address `127.0.0.5`.
- DU: F1-C DU `127.0.0.3` connecting to CU `127.0.0.5`. TDD band n78-like, `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280` (~3.6192 GHz), `N_RB 106`, numerology µ=1.
- UE: DL/UL frequency 3.6192 GHz, µ=1, tries to connect to rfsim server `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly.

Initial mismatch cues:
- CU immediately fails NGAP SCTP association due to invalid AMF IP (`999.999.999.999`). This prevents CU from fully operating and also leaves F1 server-side in a bad state.
- Independently of the AMF IP issue, `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is out-of-range for typical operator deployments and can cause NG Setup issues even if AMF IP were correct. The CU log prints a derived “macro gNB id 3584,” suggesting OAI masks or reinterprets the configured ID; this inconsistency is a red flag.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode and build: SA mode, develop branch.
- RAN context: CU-only (no MAC/L1), as expected for split CU/DU.
- Identity: `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU`. NGAP registers macro gNB id 3584.
- GTP-U: bound to `192.168.8.43:2152` in SA mode.
- Threads for NGAP, RRC, GTP-U spawned.
- F1AP at CU is started, but soon after: assertion in `sctp_handle_new_association_req()` because `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999)` fails → “Exiting execution.” This aborts the CU before it can accept DU’s F1 connection.
- Repeated config library reads of `GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, `NETParams` appear around shutdown.

Relevance to `gNBs.gNB_ID`: CU logs show “macro gNB id 3584,” not `0xFFFFFFFF`. This implies the configured `gNB_ID` is either masked/truncated to a smaller macro ID (e.g., 12-bit/22-bit portion), or OAI overwrote/overrode from another field. Such a disparity is dangerous: even if CU started, NG Setup could fail if the encoded `gNB-ID` length and value don’t match network expectations. However, the immediate crash here is due to invalid AMF IP, preempting any NGAP identity validation.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 correctly for n78-like TDD at 3.6192 GHz, µ=1, `N_RB 106`.
- F1AP DU attempts SCTP to CU: DU `127.0.0.3` → CU `127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and `[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...` → CU side F1 server not accepting because CU crashed (AMF IP failure) prior to or during F1 server bring-up.
- DU waits for F1 Setup Response before radio activation; hence radio remains inactive.

Relevance to `gNBs.gNB_ID`: DU F1 association depends on CU’s identity and F1 setup; if CU had stayed up but advertised an inconsistent gNB identity (due to `0xFFFFFFFF`), F1 might still proceed (F1 uses DU/CU IDs independently of NGAP gNB-ID). The primary symptom in DU logs is caused by CU unavailability, not PHY/PRACH misconfig.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes for 3.6192 GHz, µ=1, `N_RB_DL 106` → matches DU PHY.
- RFsim client repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails with errno 111 (connection refused). In OAI, the rfsim “server” typically runs on the gNB/DU process; because DU holds radio activation until F1 setup completes (which never happens), rfsim server side is not ready → UE cannot connect.

Relevance to `gNBs.gNB_ID`: UE failure is a downstream effect of CU crash → DU never activates → RFsim server not listening.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU parses invalid AMF IP, fails SCTP `getaddrinfo` → process exits.
  - DU repeatedly attempts F1 to CU and gets connection refused.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server since DU has not activated radio.
- Misconfigured parameter given: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - Even if AMF IP were corrected, `0xFFFFFFFF` is not a realistic operator gNB identity and may exceed the selected NGAP `gNB-ID` bit-length, causing NG Setup failure (e.g., NGAP PDU encoding error or AMF rejection). OAI’s printout of macro gNB id 3584 suggests internal masking, which can cause identity mismatches versus intended `gNB_ID` and instability during NG Setup.
  - Therefore, the run exhibits two issues: (1) blocking misconfig: invalid AMF IP; (2) latent/root misconfig per prompt: `gNBs.gNB_ID` set to an out-of-range all-ones value. The second would surface at NG Setup even after fixing AMF IP.

Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param): configuring `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` violates NGAP identity constraints and leads to identity inconsistency between configured gNB-ID and derived macro gNB id, likely causing NG Setup failure. In this specific log, an additional independent misconfig (invalid AMF IP) caused an earlier crash masking the gNB-ID issue.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration changes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, operator-appropriate value consistent with the NGAP `gNB-ID` bit length. Given logs show 3584, use that exact value (decimal or hex `0xE00`) to align all components.
- Correct AMF IP to a valid address reachable from CU.
- Ensure DU/CU F1 addresses match and are reachable (`127.0.0.3` ↔ `127.0.0.5` are fine for local RFsim).

Example corrected snippets (JSON-style, comments indicating changes):

        "server_port": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks and tools:
- After applying the config, bring up CU first and verify NGAP SCTP established to AMF. Check CU logs for NG Setup Request/Response success.
- Then start DU and confirm F1 Setup completes; DU activates radio.
- Finally start UE; ensure rfsim connects and RACH/Attach proceeds.
- If NG Setup still fails, print and verify the NGAP `gNB-ID` IE in the setup request matches the configured value and selected bit length.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and mix multiple issues (invalid AMF IP masks the `gNB_ID` problem). No explicit NGAP PDU traces are provided to confirm the exact encoding failure of `gNB-ID`.
- The precise bit-length configured for NGAP `gNB-ID` in this environment isn’t shown; recommendation uses a safe, reasonable value (3584) consistent with CU prints.
- Assessed behavior is based on OAI’s typical handling of NGAP identities and standard 3GPP constraints; exact reactions may vary with OAI revision.
