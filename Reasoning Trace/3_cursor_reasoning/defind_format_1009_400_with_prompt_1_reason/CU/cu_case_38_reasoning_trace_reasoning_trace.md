## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

The setup runs OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR in standalone mode with the RF simulator: CU and DU started with `--rfsim --sa`, and a UE also using rfsimulator. The expected flow is: (1) CU and DU initialize; (2) F1-C SCTP association is established (DU→CU); (3) CU connects to AMF via NGAP; (4) DU activates radio; (5) UE connects to the rfsim server, synchronizes to SSB, performs PRACH (RACH), gets RRC setup, and proceeds to PDU session.

Input `misconfigured_param` indicates `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. The `network_config.gnb_conf` thus contains an out-of-range gNB ID. In OAI and 3GPP, the gNB identifier field is a bounded bitstring (typically 22..32 bits depending on deployment and PLMN/cell identity composition). Setting `0xFFFFFFFF` (full 32-bit all-ones) commonly violates configured bit-length and OAI’s config checks. This can cause early configuration validation failures at the CU, preventing F1 setup, which then blocks DU radio activation and leaves the UE unable to connect to the rfsim server endpoint.

Key parameters inferred from logs and typical defaults:
- **CU/DU mode**: SA with rfsim.
- **Frequencies**: DU and UE show DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, N_RB 106, µ=1, TDD pattern consistent.
- **DU F1-C**: DU tries `127.0.0.3 → 127.0.0.5` SCTP.
- **UE rfsim**: UE repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- **Other CU config issues visible**: `mnc_length 9999999 invalid` (secondary misconfig seen in logs; main guided root cause remains `gNB_ID`).


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU confirms SA mode, version, and starts reading config sections. It then prints:
  - `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, naming `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
  - A config validation error: `mnc_length: 9999999 invalid value, authorized values: 2 3` and `config_execcheck ... wrong value` followed by `Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.

Interpretation:
- The CU terminates during configuration validation (config_execcheck). While the log explicitly flags `mnc_length`, the guided misconfiguration is `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In OAI, `gNB_ID` is checked for valid range/bit-length. A too-large/all-ones ID commonly fails checks or leads to downstream encoding failures (e.g., NGAP/F1AP node ID encoding). Given CU exits before F1/NGAP setup, any DU connection attempts will be refused.
- Cross-reference to config: An invalid `gNB_ID` in the CU config is sufficient to keep CU from running reliably; the observed `mnc_length` error corroborates that the configuration file contains invalid values and that config validation is actively rejecting the setup.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC correctly and prepares TDD configuration, frequencies (3619.2 MHz), and frame parameters (N_RB=106, µ=1). It then starts F1AP:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
  - Repeatedly: `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and `Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...`.
  - `GNB_APP waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` persists; therefore, radio stays inactive.

Interpretation:
- Connection refused implies no CU is listening at `127.0.0.5` SCTP port. This aligns with the CU exiting due to configuration validation failures. DU is otherwise healthy and waiting on CU; no PRACH or UE scheduling can proceed without F1 Setup.
- The DU logs do not show PRACH/MAC assertion errors; the block is strictly at F1-C establishment due to CU unavailability.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes at the same numerology/frequency, then tries to connect to the rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails repeatedly with `errno(111)` (connection refused).

Interpretation:
- In rfsim mode, the DU typically acts as the rfsim server. Because the DU has not activated radio (blocked by missing F1 Setup Response from CU), the rfsim server side is not accepting connections, resulting in UE connection failures. Thus, the UE symptoms are a consequence of CU startup failure.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Synthesis across components:
- CU exits during config validation; DU cannot form F1-C SCTP; UE cannot connect to rfsim server. This ordering is consistent with a CU config problem.
- Guided by `misconfigured_param = gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, the root cause is an invalid gNB identifier value in the CU configuration. OAI expects `gNB_ID` to fit the configured bit-length (commonly ≤ 32 bits but constrained by the selected `gNB_ID` size and NRCellID composition), and all-ones `0xFFFFFFFF` does not pass validation/encoding in typical OAI configurations. This triggers `config_execcheck` failure and CU termination.
- The secondary `mnc_length` error further proves the configuration has invalid fields; however, even if `mnc_length` were corrected, an invalid `gNB_ID` would still prevent CU from operating and block the rest of the chain.

Root cause: Invalid `gNB_ID` (`0xFFFFFFFF`) causes the CU to fail configuration validation and exit, preventing F1 setup and downstream UE connectivity.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within the configured bit-length (example small values are commonly used in OAI samples): e.g., `0x000001`.
- Also correct `mnc_length` to an allowed value (2 or 3) to avoid the separate validation error shown in the log.

Suggested corrected snippets (illustrative; adapt to your exact schema):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001",  // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a valid small ID
        "plmn_list": [
          {
            "mcc": 1,
            "mnc": 1,
            "mnc_length": 2      // changed from 9999999 to allowed value 2 or 3
          }
        ]
      },
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_ipv4": "127.0.0.5",
        "DU_ipv4": "127.0.0.3"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1:4043",
      "dl_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
      "ul_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
      "numerology": 1,
      "n_rb_dl": 106
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after changes:
- Start CU and ensure no config_execcheck errors remain (watch for both `gNB_ID` and PLMN fields).
- Start DU; verify F1-C SCTP association succeeds and `F1 Setup Response` is received; observe `activating radio` messages.
- Start UE; confirm rfsim connection succeeds, SSB is detected, and RACH/RRC proceeds.

Further analysis (if issues persist):
- If F1 still fails, confirm IP/ports and that CU is actually listening. Validate that `gNB_ID` is consistent across CU/DU where required.
- For standards conformance, ensure the chosen `gNB_ID` value fits the configured bit-length and that NR cell identity composition remains valid for SIB1.


## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not show the explicit `gNB_ID` validation error; the analysis is guided by the provided `misconfigured_param` and by the CU’s general `config_execcheck` failure plus the DU’s repeated `connection refused` symptoms. The `mnc_length` error is also present and must be fixed, but the primary guided root cause is the invalid `gNB_ID`.
- Exact permitted bit-length for `gNB_ID` depends on implementation and configured identity size; select a value that fits your configuration (typical OAI examples use small hexadecimal values). If needed, consult 3GPP (NGAP and NR-RRC specs) and OAI sample configs for the precise bounds used in your build.
