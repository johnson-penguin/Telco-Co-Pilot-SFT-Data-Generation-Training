## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The scenario is a 5G NR Standalone (SA) deployment of OpenAirInterface (OAI) using RF simulator (rfsim). Evidence:
- CU/DU logs show SA mode and F1AP startup; UE logs show repeated attempts to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.
- CU log shows command line includes `--rfsim --sa`.

Expected flow in SA+rfsim:
1) CU initializes NGAP/GT-PU and F1-C; DU initializes L1/L2 and F1-C; UE attempts rfsim TCP connect to the DU’s rfsim server, then PRACH/Random Access; RRC attach; NGAP registration; PDU session.
2) DU activates radio only after successful F1 Setup Response from CU.

Input highlights:
- misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- CU logs: invalid AMF IP parsed `999.999.999.999` → SCTP `getaddrinfo` failure and CU exits. F1AP at CU starts but CU dies before accepting DU F1-C association.
- DU logs: F1-C connect to CU `127.0.0.5` repeatedly refused; DU prints “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio”.
- UE logs: rfsim TCP connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly fails (connection refused) because DU never activates rfsim server.

About `gNB_ID` constraints: In NR, the gNB identifier is a 22-bit value (range 0..2^22−1). `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all-ones) exceeds the allowed range and is invalid for OAI NR configuration. In OAI, `gNBs.gNB_ID` feeds into NGAP/F1AP identities (e.g., macro gNB id, CU/DU IDs) and must be consistent across CU/DU components.

Network config (from the snippets observable in logs):
- `gnb_conf` (effective values inferred):
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID`: 0xFFFFFFFF (misconfigured)
  - `amf_ip_address`: 999.999.999.999 (invalid IPv4)
  - `F1-C CU IP`: 127.0.0.5; `F1-C DU IP`: 127.0.0.3 (from DU log)
  - TDD common config present; band n78 frequencies (3619200000 Hz); N_RB 106; SIB1 offsetToPointA 86
- `ue_conf` (effective):
  - DL/UL freq 3619200000 Hz; numerology μ=1; N_RB_DL 106
  - rfsimulator client to 127.0.0.1:4043

Initial mismatch observations:
- `gNB_ID` invalid (too large). This can corrupt identity-related encodings (NGAP, F1AP) and/or lead to inconsistent IDs between processes.
- AMF IP is also invalid, independently causing immediate CU SCTP failure.

Conclusion of context: even though the CU crash is immediately triggered by invalid AMF IP, the known misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is a root configuration error that would also block correct operation even after fixing the AMF IP. Both must be corrected.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key lines:
- SA mode; CU identity: `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- NGAP: “Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584” (macro ID seems derived from config but not matching `0xFFFFFFFF`, suggesting OAI masked/overrode something for display).
- GTPU configured at 192.168.8.43:2152.
- Critical failure:
  - `Parsed IPv4 address for NG AMF: 999.999.999.999`
  - `getaddrinfo(999.999.999.999) failed: Name or service not known`
  - Assertion fail in `sctp_handle_new_association_req()`; CU exits.
- CU prints `F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5` before exit, but the process terminates, so DU’s F1 connection attempts will be refused.

Cross-reference to config:
- An invalid AMF IP guarantees NGAP SCTP setup cannot proceed. Regardless, `gNB_ID` must be valid to encode NG Setup Request correctly and to be accepted by AMF later.

Outcome at CU: CU terminates early; it never handles F1 Setup from DU and never reaches operational state.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Initialization is healthy: PHY/MAC set up for n78, μ=1, N_RB 106; TDD period computed; F1AP at DU starts.
- F1-C DU IP 127.0.0.3; CU at 127.0.0.5.
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with automatic retry.
- `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → DU will not activate radio nor rfsim server without successful F1 setup.

Link to misconfiguration:
- Primary observed blocker is CU being down (due to invalid AMF IP). Even if AMF IP were valid, an invalid `gNB_ID` at either CU or DU would cause identity mismatch or protocol encoding errors on F1/NGAP. OAI typically expects consistent `gNB_ID` across CU/DU process configurations. An out-of-range `gNB_ID` may be rejected or mishandled.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
UE configuration aligns with gNB radio setup: same μ=1, N_RB 106, 3.6192 GHz.
- UE is rfsim client trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and repeatedly gets `errno(111)` connection refused.
- This is expected because DU did not activate radio/rfsim (blocked waiting for F1 Setup Response), which itself is blocked by CU crash.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
1) CU reads invalid AMF IP and asserts → CU exits.
2) DU keeps retrying F1-C, gets connection refused, and never activates radio/rfsim.
3) UE cannot connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 → repeated failures.

Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param):
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid (beyond 22-bit range) and must be corrected. Even after fixing AMF IP, this parameter would cause identity encoding issues in NGAP and/or F1AP, risking setup rejection or undefined behavior. Therefore, it is a fundamental configuration error.
- Immediate observed crash is due to invalid AMF IP, which must also be corrected, but the problem set focuses on `gNB_ID` as the misconfigured parameter causing the issue; thus we treat it as the principal root cause to address to ensure stable operation.

Why invalid `gNB_ID` breaks things:
- NGAP IE `GlobalRANNodeID` uses a 22-bit gNB ID for NR gNB. Values outside range violate spec encodings (3GPP TS 38.413/36.413 family for NGAP; and related identities in TS 38.300/38.401 for F1). OAI config and ASN.1 encoders assume the allowed range; oversized values can overflow bitfields, truncate unexpectedly, or be rejected by peers.
- F1AP `gNB-DU ID`/`gNB-CU ID` must be consistent and reasonable; while local IDs can differ from `gNB_ID`, OAI often derives or validates identity against config. Keeping `gNB_ID` in range avoids subtle failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration fixes (minimal, safe values):
1) Set a valid 22-bit `gNBs.gNB_ID` (example: 0x000001). Ensure the same identity context is used consistently by CU and DU configs.
2) Fix AMF IP to a valid reachable address on the CU host/network.
3) Keep F1-C addresses as currently shown (127.0.0.3↔127.0.0.5) if they are correct for your multi-process setup.

Proposed corrected configs (JSON-like snippets within the network_config structure):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001"  // changed: valid 22-bit value instead of 0xFFFFFFFF
      },
      "amf_ip_address": "192.168.8.10"  // changed: replace invalid 999.999.999.999 with a real AMF IP
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1:4043",  // unchanged: UE connects to local DU rfsim server
      "nr_band": 78,                                 // unchanged: consistent with 3619200000 Hz
      "dl_frequency_hz": 3619200000,                // unchanged
      "ul_frequency_hz": 3619200000                 // unchanged (0 offset in logs)
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after changes:
- Start CU → confirm NGAP SCTP established to AMF (no `getaddrinfo` errors), and NG Setup successful; verify NGAP shows expected `GlobalRANNodeID`.
- Start DU → confirm F1 Setup completes and DU prints “activating radio”; rfsim server should bind (UE connects successfully).
- Start UE → verify rfsim TCP connect succeeds, SSB detected, PRACH/RA occurs, RRC setup proceeds.

Additional debugging if issues persist:
- Enable verbose logs for NGAP/F1AP; capture NG Setup Request/Response to check identities.
- If multi-instance, ensure CU/DU configs both use the corrected `gNB_ID` and compatible PLMN/TAC.

## 7. Limitations
- Provided logs are truncated and do not include full configuration JSON; recommended fixes assume standard OAI NR SA+rfsim topology.
- CU crash due to invalid AMF IP is a separate misconfiguration not specified in `misconfigured_param` but must be fixed for progress.
- The `gNB_ID` 22-bit assertion is based on NR identity encoding per 3GPP; OAI-specific constraints follow these ranges but exact enforcement points may differ by branch/version.
