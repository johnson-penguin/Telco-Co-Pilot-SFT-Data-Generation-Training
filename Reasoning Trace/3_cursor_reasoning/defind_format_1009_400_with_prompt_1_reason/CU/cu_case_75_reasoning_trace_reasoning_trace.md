## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- Running OAI NR SA with rfsim (logs show "--rfsim --sa").
- Expected flow: CU/DU init → F1-C SCTP association → NGAP (CU↔AMF) → DU radio activation → UE connects via rfsim port → PRACH/RRC attach → PDU session.
- Given misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (all 1s in 32 bits). In NR/NGAP, the gNB-ID is encoded as a fixed-length BIT STRING with size 22 bits per 3GPP TS 38.413 (NGAP) and 38.410; valid range is 0 … 2^22-1 (0 … 4194303). `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) exceeds the maximum and cannot be encoded in the allowed bit length, causing config validation to fail.
- Network config JSON was not included; however, CU logs show additional config issues (e.g., `mcc: -1 invalid value`). Even if other parameters are valid, an out-of-range `gNB_ID` alone is sufficient to abort CU startup before F1/NGAP.

Initial correlation:
- CU terminates during config checks.
- DU initializes but cannot complete F1 setup (SCTP connect refused) because CU is not running.
- UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server (`connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)`) because DU keeps radio deactivated until F1 Setup Response; hence no rfsim server is accepting connections.

Conclusion: A fatal CU-side configuration error (invalid `gNB_ID`) prevents the entire chain from progressing.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- SA mode confirmed; build metadata present.
- Early config checks print:
  - `config_check_intrange: mcc: -1 invalid value` and `plmn_list.[0] ... wrong value`.
  - Multiple reads of `GNBSParams` followed by: `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- No evidence of AMF/SCTP/NGAP attempts; exit occurs during config validation phase.

How it ties to `gNB_ID`:
- OAI performs range/type checks on critical identifiers during `config_execcheck`. A `gNB_ID` beyond the supported bit-length triggers failure. Combined with any PLMN errors, CU exits immediately, never bringing up F1-C server side to accept DU connections.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU fully initializes PHY/MAC, TDD, frequencies, and threads.
- Attempts F1-C association to CU:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5 ...`
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and `retrying...` loops.
- DU prints: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

Interpretation:
- The DU is healthy but cannot reach CU because CU exited on config errors. Without F1 Setup Response, DU keeps radio inactive; in rfsim, this means the simulated RF server does not accept UE connections.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY and threads with matching numerology/band (N_RB 106, DL 3619 MHz, TDD).
- Repeatedly tries to connect to rfsim server: `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` → `connect() ... failed, errno(111)`.

Interpretation:
- No rfsim server is listening because DU has not activated radio pending F1 setup; DU is waiting on CU that never started due to invalid `gNB_ID` (and possibly PLMN errors).

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline linkage:
  - CU exits during config validation → DU F1-C connect refused → DU keeps radio off → UE cannot connect to rfsim port.
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - 3GPP encoding constraints (NGAP gNB-ID size = 22 bits) prohibit this value; OAI config parser enforces limits and aborts on error.
  - Even if DU/UE parameters are fine, CU failure explains all subsequent symptoms (SCTP refused, rfsim connect failures).
- Additional CU log hint (`mcc: -1`) suggests PLMN misconfig; fix it as well to avoid secondary failures after correcting `gNB_ID`.

Root cause: Out-of-range `gNB_ID` breaks CU configuration validation, preventing F1/NGAP setup and blocking the entire attach flow.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Mandatory fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a value within 22-bit range (e.g., `0x0000A1` or decimal `161`). Ensure the CU and DU use consistent `gNB_DU_id/gNB_CU_id` semantics where applicable and do not conflate with `NR cellId` (different concepts).
- Correct PLMN fields (e.g., `mcc` in [0..999], `mnc` length 2 or 3, consistent with core network and SIB1).

Suggested CU `gnb_conf` snippet (illustrative; keep other site-specific fields unchanged):

```json
{
  "gnb_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "gNB_ID": "0x0000A1", // FIX: within 22-bit range (<= 0x3FFFFF)
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
        "mcc": 1,              // FIX: valid range 0..999 (example: 001)
        "mnc": 1,              // FIX: 01 (2-digit) or 001 (3-digit) depending on AMF config
        "mnc_length": 2,
        "ngap": {
          "amf_ip_address": "127.0.0.18",
          "gnb_ngap_ip": "127.0.0.5"
        },
        "f1ap": {
          "gnb_cu_f1c_ip": "127.0.0.5"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Suggested DU `gnb_conf` snippet (align with CU addresses already seen in logs):

```json
{
  "gnb_conf": {
    "gNBs": [
      {
        "gNB_ID": "0x0000A1", // Same gNB ID space; ensure DU-side constraints match OAI expectations
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-DU",
        "f1ap": {
          "gnb_du_f1c_ip": "127.0.0.3",
          "gnb_cu_f1c_ip": "127.0.0.5" // must match CU listener
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Suggested UE `ue_conf` snippet (confirm rfsim server host):

```json
{
  "ue_conf": {
    "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", // unchanged; DU activates server after F1 setup
    "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
    "band": 78,
    "ssb_subcarrier_spacing": 30
  }
}
```

Operational validation steps:
- Restart CU; verify no config_execcheck failures.
- Observe DU: F1-C association should succeed; radio activates; rfsim server starts.
- Observe UE: rfsim TCP connect should succeed; PRACH and RRC proceed.
- If NGAP still fails, re-check PLMN (MCC/MNC and length) against AMF configuration and SIB1.

## 7. Limitations

- The `network_config` object was not provided; example snippets reflect values inferred from logs and typical OAI defaults.
- CU logs show another invalid parameter (`mcc: -1`) that must be corrected in addition to `gNB_ID`.
- Logs are truncated; exact NGAP/F1AP configs (ports, full SIB1/PLMN) are assumed from common OAI setups.
- Spec reference summary: NGAP `gNB-ID` is encoded on 22 bits; values outside 0..4194303 are invalid and will fail config/ASN.1 handling.
