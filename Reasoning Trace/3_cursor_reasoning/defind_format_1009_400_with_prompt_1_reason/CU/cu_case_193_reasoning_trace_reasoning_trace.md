## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The setup is OAI 5G NR SA with RF simulator enabled, evidenced by CU command line including `--rfsim --sa` and UE logs showing client attempts to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected flow: CU/DU/UE init → F1AP (DU↔CU) and NGAP (CU↔AMF) setup → DU activates radio (rfsim server) → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB/PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.
- Misconfigured parameter provided: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- Observed early CU failure during config checks; DU keeps retrying F1 SCTP; UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server.

Network configuration (parsed from the JSON intent and typical OAI defaults):
- gnb_conf (key items): `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (hex), PLMN list (MCC/MNC), loopback NG interfaces, local AMF IP, TDD band n78, SSB ARFCN around 641280.
- ue_conf (key items): IMSI aligned with PLMN, DL frequency ~3619200000 Hz, `rfsimulator_serveraddr=127.0.0.1`.

Immediate mismatch hints:
- `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is the all-ones 32-bit value. In many code paths (including OAI), configuration integers are parsed into signed 32-bit `int`. `0xFFFFFFFF` as signed becomes `-1`. This typically triggers config validation failures and can corrupt subsequent parameter validation.
- CU logs indeed show a config error on a PLMN field (`mnc: -1 invalid`), which is a classic symptom of signed overflow or parse failure earlier in the same section.

Conclusion of context: A malformed `gNB_ID` at CU breaks configuration validation, preventing CU startup; DU cannot complete F1 setup; DU keeps radio inactive (no rfsim server), hence UE cannot connect.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode/version/context:
  - "running in SA mode"
  - Version hash `b2c9a1d2b5` (May 20, 2025)
  - RC init shows CU-only (no L1/RU) as expected.
- F1AP identifiers printed: `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- Config validation failures:
  - `config_check_intrange: mnc: -1 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999`
  - `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`
  - Immediate exit: `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem`

Cross-reference:
- The provided misconfigured parameter is `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. If parsed as signed 32-bit, it becomes `-1` and may break the subsequent object parsing (same section `gNBs.[0]`), causing the MNC in memory to appear as `-1` to the checker.
- Regardless of the exact parser nuance, the CU aborts at configuration time, never bringing up NGAP or F1-C endpoints.

Impact:
- CU does not listen for F1-C; any DU F1 SCTP connection will be refused.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU successfully and computes TDD pattern, frequencies, and SIB1 details. No PRS/RedCap is fine and unrelated.
- F1AP client attempts to connect to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated: `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused`, `Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...`.
- DU prints: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

Cross-reference:
- Because CU aborted at config time, there is no SCTP listener; DU is stuck retrying. DU will not activate radio or start the rfsim RF server until F1 setup completes.

Impact:
- No rfsim server is started; UE cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY, actors, and RF chains; runs as RF simulator client.
- Repeated: `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` followed by `connect() ... failed, errno(111)`.

Cross-reference:
- This is consistent with DU never starting the rfsim server due to missing F1 setup. Root cause is upstream at CU configuration failure.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Correlation timeline:
- CU fails during config → no F1-C listener.
- DU retries F1 → never activates radio/rfsim.
- UE fails to connect to rfsim server repeatedly.

Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param):
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid for OAI configuration parsing/validation.
  - In NGAP, the gNB-ID field supports 22–32 bits, but OAI configuration layer historically stores IDs in signed 32-bit integers. The literal `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) overflows `int32_t` and becomes `-1`.
  - This causes config_execcheck to trip, and can also perturb subsequent field validations (observed `mnc: -1 invalid`).
- Therefore, the CU exits before serving F1/NG, causing the downstream DU/UE symptoms.

Optional spec/code note:
- 3GPP NGAP Global gNB ID allows gNB-ID bit length in [22..32]. Even if 32 bits are allowed by spec, the configuration must use a valid non-negative value that fits the implementation’s type and any local constraints. Values near `2^32-1` are unsafe if parsed as signed.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, positive value that fits in signed 32-bit and your deployment convention. Examples: decimal `3584` (seen as CU ID print), or a modest hex like `0x000ABCDE`.
- Ensure PLMN fields are valid: `mcc` 208, `mnc` 93, `mnc_length` 2.

Suggested corrected snippets (JSON-form, illustrative):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNB_ID": 3584, // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF; small positive fits int32
      "plmn_list": [
        { "mcc": 208, "mnc": 93, "mnc_length": 2 }
      ],
      "amf_ip_address": {
        "ipv4": "127.0.0.1", "ipv6": "::1", "active": "yes", "preference": "ipv4"
      },
      "network_interfaces": {
        "gnb_interface_name_for_NG_AMF": "lo",
        "gnb_ipv4_address_for_NG_AMF": "127.0.0.1/8",
        "gnb_interface_name_for_NG_UP": "lo",
        "gnb_ipv4_address_for_NG_UP": "127.0.0.1/8"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "imsi": "208930000000031",
      "frequency": 3619200000,
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update CU and DU configs with the same `gNB_ID` value.
- Restart CU first; verify no config_execcheck errors.
- Start DU; confirm F1 Setup succeeds and DU activates radio (you should see rfsim server up).
- Start UE; verify connection to `127.0.0.1:4043` succeeds, SSB detected, PRACH and RRC proceed.

Further analysis (if issues persist):
- If config still flags PLMN, recheck for stray hex or negative values elsewhere; ensure no trailing comments on same line that could confuse parser.
- Inspect OAI `config_userapi` handling of `gNB_ID` for signed/hex parsing; prefer decimal to avoid ambiguity.
- Validate NGAP Global gNB ID encoding in traces (should reflect the corrected value).

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and anonymized; exact `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` not fully provided. The MNC `-1` error is interpreted as a downstream symptom from the `gNB_ID` overflow; alternative causes (such as an actual bad MNC in the file) cannot be fully excluded without the configs.
- Spec references (e.g., NGAP Global gNB ID 22–32 bits) are applied at a high level; implementation constraints in OAI’s config layer (signed int, decimal vs hex) govern the observed failure.
