## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

This scenario is an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) setup running with the RF simulator (`--rfsim`) based on CU/DU/UE logs. The expected flow is: component initialization → F1 setup (DU↔CU) and NGAP setup (CU↔AMF) → broadcast SIBs → UE synchronization and PRACH → RRC connection and registration → PDU session.

The provided error seed is the configuration: `misconfigured_param = gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` in the gNB configuration. The `network_config` object indicates this value is present in `gnb_conf`. A valid `gNB_ID` must comply with NGAP’s Global gNB ID constraints: the `gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING of length 22..32 bits (commonly 22 bits used by OAI defaults). A value of `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits with all ones) does not comply with typical OAI handling which expects a bounded-length ID (e.g., 22 bits) and often enforces range checks consistent with 3GPP. Practically, values beyond the allowed bit-length or range can lead to encoding/decoding failures for NGAP/F1AP identities or internal assertions.

High-signal parameters parsed from the logs and implied config:
- Mode: SA, rfsim enabled for CU, DU, UE.
- DU RF/PHY: band n78-ish center at 3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, μ=1, TDD pattern configured.
- F1 addresses: DU F1-C local 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5 (SCTP), GTP-U 127.0.0.3:2152.
- UE repeatedly attempts RFSIM connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 and fails (errno 111: connection refused).
- Security warning on CU for unknown `nea9` cipher (non-blocking for this root-cause but should be corrected later).

Initial suspicion from the misconfigured parameter: an invalid `gNB_ID` breaks CU’s NG setup and/or CU F1-C endpoint creation, causing DU’s F1-C association attempts to be refused and UE’s rfsim client to fail to reach a running gNB server.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Key CU lines:
- SA mode and rfsim confirmed.
- Build info printed; RAN context initialized with no MAC/L1 (as CU).
- F1AP role lines: `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- Config file load in `GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, etc.
- Warning: `[RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9"`.

Notably absent: no logs indicating NGAP SCTP connection to AMF, no F1AP server listening confirmation for CU, and no F1 Setup handling messages. This silence is consistent with an early failure in identity/config processing or a failure to start F1-C server correctly. An out-of-range `gNB_ID` would impact both NGAP (Global gNB ID IE) and possibly F1AP node identities. If the CU fails to initialize NG and/or F1 services, DU connection attempts will be refused.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

DU initializes fully at PHY/MAC:
- PHY initialized, TDD configured (8 DL, 3 UL slots per 10-slot pattern), DL/UL at 3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, μ=1.
- F1AP client attempts: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and F1AP retry loop; `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

This shows the DU is healthy enough to reach F1 establishment but is blocked because the CU F1-C endpoint is not accepting SCTP (connection refused indicates no listener). That aligns with the hypothesis that CU initialization failed to bring F1 up due to the invalid `gNB_ID`.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

UE PHY config matches DU (3619.2 MHz, μ=1, 106 PRBs). UE is a rfsim client and repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)` connection refused. In OAI rfsim, the gNB (DU/RU side) usually provides the rfsim server endpoint; if the gNB is not fully started (because CU didn’t accept F1 and DU waits for F1 Setup before activating radio), the rfsim server may not be active, leading to UE connection refused loops. Thus, UE failures are a downstream effect of the CU-side misconfiguration blocking DU activation.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU appears to load config but never announces NGAP/F1 listeners.
  - DU attempts SCTP to CU and gets immediate connection refused (no listener), then waits for F1 Setup Response to activate radio.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server (connection refused), because DU radio side is not activated without F1 Setup.
- Misconfigured parameter as the guiding clue: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - NGAP Global gNB ID includes `PLMNIdentity` and `gNB-ID` (BIT STRING with length constraints, typically 22..32 bits per TS 38.413). OAI commonly configures a 22-bit gNB-ID (max 0x3FFFFF). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds the expected bit-length/range and can cause:
    - ASN.1 encode errors for NGAP messages that carry Global gNB ID.
    - Internal validation failures causing CU to not start NGAP and/or F1 services.
    - Inconsistent F1AP identifiers, preventing CU from opening/advertising F1-C.
- Therefore, the invalid `gNB_ID` at CU prevents F1-C listener startup (or crashes pre-listen), which causes DU F1 connect refusals and derived UE rfsim connection refusals. This is the primary root cause.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Correct `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value. Safe choices:
  - Use a 22-bit ID within [0x000000, 0x3FFFFF], e.g., `0x000ABC` or `0x000001`.
  - Ensure consistency across CU/DU configs if both specify gNB identities.
- After fixing, restart CU first, verify it logs NGAP startup (if configured) and F1-C server listening. Then start DU, confirm F1 Setup completes and radio activates. Finally start UE; rfsim connection should succeed and UE should proceed to acquire SIB1 and attempt RRC.
- Secondary hygiene fixes:
  - Replace unsupported cipher `nea9` with supported `nea1/nea2/nea3` and corresponding `nia1/nia2/nia3`.
  - Confirm IPs/ports: CU F1-C should be listening at 127.0.0.5, DU connects from 127.0.0.3.

Proposed corrected snippets in the same structural style (JSON objects for clarity):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001"  
      },
      "security": {
        "cipheringAlgo": "nea2",  
        "integrityProtAlgo": "nia2"
      },
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_F1C_listen_addr": "127.0.0.5",
        "DU_F1C_peer_addr": "127.0.0.3"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "numerology": 1,
        "n_rb_dl": 106
      },
      "rfsimulator": {

        "server_port": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes on the changes:
- `gNB_ID` set to a valid 22-bit-range value (`0x000001`).
- Security algorithms switched to commonly supported options.
- Explicit F1 addresses shown to emphasize CU must listen and DU must connect appropriately.

Validation steps after change:
- CU log should show F1AP initialization and SCTP listening (no immediate errors on NGAP identity).
- DU should establish SCTP, receive F1 Setup Response, and log radio activation.
- UE should connect to rfsim server, acquire SSB/SIB, and proceed with RRC.


## 7. Limitations

- Logs are partial and without timestamps; we infer sequencing from message order.
- The exact `network_config` JSON beyond the misconfigured key is not fully provided; the snippets above illustrate the minimal corrections.
- The mapping between OAI config files and these JSON abstractions may vary; ensure the actual `gnb.conf` reflects the corrected values.
- While NGAP allows 22..32-bit `gNB-ID`, OAI’s implementation and typical deployments use 22-bit. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` does not align with expected ranges and breaks initialization in practice.
