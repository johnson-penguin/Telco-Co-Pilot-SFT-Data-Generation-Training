## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The setup is OAI 5G NR Standalone using `--rfsim` for CU/DU split and a UE emulator. Expected bring-up: CU initializes (NGAP to AMF, F1-C server) → DU initializes and performs F1 Setup to CU → DU activates radio/time source and opens RFsim server (TCP 4043) → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB detect/PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.

Given input:
- misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (invalid; NR gNB-ID must fit 22 bits, ≤ 0x3FFFFF).
- CU logs show NGAP initialization, an NGSetup failure followed by an NGSetupResponse, then F1AP server startup and receipt of F1 Setup Request, which is aborted due to PLMN mismatch (CU `999.01` vs DU `00101`).
- DU logs show normal PHY/MAC init, then F1AP client connection to CU, and an explicit message that the CU reported F1AP Setup Failure (configuration mismatch).
- UE logs show continuous failures to connect to RFsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` (connection refused).

Network configuration implications:
- `gnb_conf`: contains `gNBs.gNB_ID`, PLMN, TAC, F1 addresses. The misconfigured `gNB_ID` is out-of-range; OAI may clamp/derive an internal 22-bit identity (CU log hints at `3584`) leading to identity inconsistencies versus DU and AMF expectations. The CU also indicates PLMN mismatch with the DU.
- `ue_conf`: RFsim address/port and carrier frequency around 3619.2 MHz appear aligned with DU configs; no direct UE-side misconfig is indicated by logs.

High-level mismatch summary:
- CU: invalid `gNB_ID` (and likely PLMN/TAC inconsistencies) → NGAP instability and identity mismatch, F1AP Setup rejected due to PLMN mismatch.
- DU: cannot complete F1 setup (CU rejects) → radio not activated → RFsim server not listening.
- UE: cannot connect to RFsim TCP 4043 due to DU not listening → no SSB/PRACH.

Conclusion at this stage: A CU configuration defect centered on an invalid `gNB_ID` combined with PLMN mismatch prevents F1 establishment; this blocks DU activation and UE RFsim connectivity.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key stages:
- SA mode, threads and tasks for NGAP, RRC, GTPU created.
- NGAP: `Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584` and `Send NGSetupRequest to AMF` → `Received NG setup failure ... please check your parameters` → later `Received NGSetupResponse` (indicates parameter correction/tolerance by AMF or retry success, but identity parameters may still be inconsistent).
- F1AP CU starts; binds at `127.0.0.5`. GTPU instance created locally for CU, consistent with SA.
- F1 Setup Request received from DU `3584 (gNB-Eurecom-DU)`; then `PLMN mismatch: CU 999.01, DU 00101` → SCTP shutdown → endpoint removed → `no DU connected ... F1 Setup Failed?`.

Interpretation:
- The CU progressed far enough to advertise F1-C and exchange with DU. However, identity and PLMN parameters are inconsistent across CU and DU. The logged macro gNB id of `3584` suggests OAI derived or masked the configured `gNB_ID` (given misconfig 0xFFFFFFFF) down to an internal 22-bit representation, which may not match the DU’s expectations. The explicit PLMN mismatch is fatal for F1 setup.

Cross-reference with config:
- CU `gNBs.gNB_ID` must be ≤ 0x3FFFFF and equal across CU/DU if they present a consistent gNB identity to AMF and each other. PLMN (MCC/MNC) must match across CU and DU as well. Any out-of-range value results in clamping/mapping or failure; both can break interop.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Key stages:
- PHY/MAC/RU initialization normal (TDD, 106 PRBs, µ=1, SSB abs freq 3619200000 Hz). F1 client configured to connect to CU `127.0.0.5`.
- GTPU bind for DU, time manager configured. A clear indication: `[MAC] the CU reported F1AP Setup Failure, is there a configuration mismatch?`

Interpretation:
- The DU is healthy at PHY/MAC/scheduler level. The DU reaches F1 Setup but is rejected by CU due to configuration inconsistency (CU log shows PLMN mismatch). As a result, the DU does not complete activation of radio and does not open RFsim server for UE.

Link to `gnb_conf` parameters:
- DU’s PLMN `001/01` (formatted `00101`) conflicts with CU’s `999/01` per CU log. Also, `gNB_ID` must align across CU and DU F1 identity and with NGAP identity composition for consistency.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Key stages:
- UE initializes for 106 PRBs at 3619.2 MHz; multiple actors and RF chains are configured for RFsim.
- UE attempts to connect repeatedly to `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` (connection refused) continuously.

Interpretation:
- In RFsim, the DU serves as the TCP server at 4043 after radio activation. Since F1 Setup failed, DU never enters the active radio state, so 4043 is not listening. The UE’s failure is a consequence of the CU/DU configuration mismatch rather than a UE-side issue.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
1) CU config contains invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (out-of-range). OAI likely masks to 22 bits, yielding an internal gNB-ID (seen as 3584) that is not what the operator intended and is inconsistent with DU and AMF expectations.
2) CU/DU PLMN mismatch is detected at F1 Setup and causes SCTP shutdown; CU rejects DU’s F1 Setup.
3) DU cannot activate radio nor open RFsim server; UE cannot connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and loops with connection refused.

Why `gNB_ID` matters here:
- NR gNB-ID is ≤ 22 bits per 3GPP and used in NGAP and F1 identity. An out-of-range configuration may be truncated or rejected by OAI, causing inconsistent `cellIdentity`/`gNB-DU-ID`/`gNB-CU-ID` derivations and leading to registration or setup failures with AMF or between CU and DU. The CU’s log showing `macro gNB id 3584` amidst a configured `0xFFFFFFFF` suggests the identity used at runtime does not match the DU’s (and possibly AMF’s) expectations, exacerbating the explicit PLMN mismatch.

If spec confirmation is needed: consult 3GPP TS 38.413/38.331 for identity ranges, and OAI documentation for `gNB_ID` constraints and validation behavior.

Root cause:
- Primary: Invalid CU `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (out of allowed range) leading to identity inconsistency; combined with a PLMN mismatch (CU `999.01` vs DU `001/01`) causing F1 Setup Failure. This blocks DU activation and UE RFsim connectivity.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Required configuration fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid 22-bit value shared consistently across CU and DU, e.g., `0x000E00` (3584) or another value ≤ `0x3FFFFF` that both sides use identically.
- Align PLMN between CU and DU (e.g., MCC `001`, MNC `01`) and ensure AMF is configured for the same TAC/PLMN.
- Verify TAC is within allowed range (1..65533) and consistent across network functions.

Post-fix validation steps:
- Start CU: confirm NGSetupRequest/Response succeeds with AMF and F1-C is listening.
- Start DU: F1 Setup Request/Response should complete; DU should log radio activation and RFsim server start.
- Start UE: verify TCP connect to 4043 succeeds; observe SSB detect, PRACH, RRC attach.

        "mnc": "01"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Further analysis tips:
- If NGAP setup still fails, enable verbose NGAP logging and verify `ServedGUMMEIs/TAIs` match PLMN/TAC. Confirm `nrCellId` encoding matches `gNB_ID` and `cellIdentity`.
- If F1 Setup still fails, compare `gNB_DU_id`, PLMN, and cell identity between DU and CU traces to ensure byte-for-byte match.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are partial and without timestamps; ordering is inferred from content.
- The full `network_config` JSON was not provided; fixes target clearly implicated fields (gNB_ID, PLMN, TAC, endpoints).
- While the misconfigured `gNB_ID` is the guiding defect, the explicit PLMN mismatch must also be corrected for F1 success.
