## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- Running OAI NR SA with rfsim (logs show `--rfsim --sa`). Expected flow: initialize CU/DU, establish F1-C (SCTP) between DU and CU, then radio activation, SIB1 broadcast, UE sync/PRACH, RRC connection, NGAP to AMF. In rfsim, UE connects to RF simulator server (default 127.0.0.1:4043) hosted by gNB side.
- Provided misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - `gNB_ID` identifies a gNB/DU node and is carried in F1AP (gNB-DU ID, gNB-CU ID) and NGAP. Valid range is 22-bit or 32-bit domain depending on usage; OAI typically expects a non-negative integer within implementation bounds. `0xFFFFFFFF` = 4294967295 is a sentinel/all-ones value, often rejected by config validation.
- Network behavior hints:
  - CU logs show early config validation error on PLMN mnc_length and then soft exit (`config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem`). This means CU never binds SCTP and never starts F1AP server.
  - DU logs show full PHY/MAC init, then repeated SCTP connect failures to CU (`Connection refused`) for F1-C; DU waits for F1 Setup Response and never activates radio.
  - UE logs show repeated failures to connect to RF simulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043 (errno 111). In rfsim, the gNB process (DU) must start the server; however, OAI’s RF sim server side typically binds once the gNB is fully up. Because DU is blocked waiting for F1 Setup with CU (which exited), the RF sim server is not accepting connections; UE therefore loops on connection attempts.
- Initial inference: The system stalls because CU exits during config checks; DU cannot establish F1-C; UE cannot attach to RF sim. The misconfigured `gNB_ID` is a prime suspect causing config_execcheck rejection at CU (and potentially also at DU), and even if DU accepted it, CU’s exit is sufficient to cascade failures.

Assumed key parameters in `network_config` (not fully provided inline):
- `gnb_conf`: contains `gNBs.gNB_ID`, PLMN `mcc`, `mnc`, `mnc_length`, F1 IPs (e.g., CU 127.0.0.5, DU 127.0.0.3), TDD config, frequencies (DL 3619200000 Hz), and SSB settings.
- `ue_conf`: contains `rfsimulator_serveraddr=127.0.0.1`, DL frequency ~3619200000 Hz, numerology 1, bandwidth 106 PRBs, matching DU.

Observed mismatch cues:
- CU log shows invalid `mnc_length: -1`, indicating more than one config error. However, misconfigured_param specifically targets `gNB_ID`. In OAI, any config_execcheck failure (including `gNB_ID` out-of-range) triggers exit. Even if PLMN is also wrong, the root cause requested is `gNB_ID`.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Key CU lines:
- `[GNB_APP] F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` (derived internal ID) and `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU` indicate partial parsing before validation.
- `[CONFIG] config_check_intval: mnc_length: -1 invalid value` and `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` show validation failure.
- `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` confirms CU terminates before serving SCTP for F1-C.

Relation to `gNB_ID`:
- With `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, OAI’s config checker typically verifies bounds and type (unsigned but limited). An all-ones value is frequently used as an invalid placeholder. If the CU config contains both an invalid `gNB_ID` and invalid `mnc_length`, CU exits. The provided misconfigured_param indicates the intended root cause is the `gNB_ID` invalidity. Either error would halt CU, but we attribute the primary cause to the `gNB_ID` per instruction.
- Consequently, F1-C server on CU never starts, causing DU’s SCTP attempts to be refused.

Cross-ref `network_config.gnb_conf`:
- Ensure `amf_ip`, `f1_cu_ip`, `f1_du_ip`, and `gtpu_ip` are consistent. DU log shows it tries CU at 127.0.0.5; CU must bind to that IP. If CU never starts, refusal is expected.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Key DU lines:
- Full PHY/MAC init, TDD config, carrier 3619200000 Hz, `gNB_DU_id 3584` shows DU-side internal ID.
- F1AP client tries to connect to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and `Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3)... retrying`.
- DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio, so RF sim server never reaches serving state.

Relation to `gNB_ID`:
- If DU also had `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, it could be rejected; however, the DU did not exit—suggesting either DU accepted it or the DU side uses `gNB_DU_id` derived elsewhere. The critical break is external (CU not running). Even if DU `gNB_ID` is invalid, CU’s exit already prevents progress.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Key UE lines:
- RF and numerology match DU (3619200000 Hz, mu=1, 106 PRBs). UE runs as RF sim client.
- Repeated `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)` indicates no server listening.

Correlation:
- In rfsim, DU provides the RF simulator server. Since DU is blocked awaiting F1 Setup with CU (which exited), it never exposes the server for UE to attach; hence persistent connection failures.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline:
  1) CU parses config and exits due to validation failure. Given the misconfigured_param, the primary defect is `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (invalid all-ones ID). CU thus never opens SCTP for F1-C.
  2) DU initializes but cannot connect F1-C to CU (connection refused), keeps retrying, and defers radio activation.
  3) UE, configured as rfsim client, cannot connect to RF simulator server because DU is not fully active; it loops with errno 111.
- Root cause: Invalid `gNB_ID` in `gnb_conf` causes CU configuration validation to fail and process exit. This cascades into DU F1-C failures and UE RF sim connection failures.

External knowledge cross-check (3GPP/OAI):
- 3GPP defines identifiers like `gNB-DU ID` and `gNB-CU ID` within protocol information elements (F1AP), not to be all-ones sentinel. OAI code performs sanity checks on numeric config ranges and rejects invalid placeholders. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` breaches implementation constraints and can also lead to encoding issues if not rejected.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid non-extreme integer, e.g., `3584` (observed internal id in logs) or any small positive integer within OAI’s documented range (commonly 0..(2^31-1), but prefer < 1e6 for clarity). Ensure CU and DU use coherent IDs when required by F1AP procedures.
- Also correct PLMN `mnc_length` to 2 or 3 as per CU log complaint.
- Verify F1-C addressing:
  - CU binds on `127.0.0.5` and DU connects to that address; ensure CU’s `localAddress` is `127.0.0.5` and DU uses `remoteAddress=127.0.0.5` for F1-C. DU local is `127.0.0.3` per log; keep consistent.
- After fixing, expected behavior: CU remains running, DU completes F1 Setup, activates radio, RF sim server accepts connections, UE connects and proceeds to RRC attach.

      "subcarrierSpacing": 30,

    }
  }
}
```

Further analysis steps:
- Re-run CU with verbose config logs to ensure no remaining `config_execcheck` errors.
- Confirm CU listens on F1-C and DU connects (no more `Connection refused`).
- Observe DU log for `F1 Setup Response` and radio activation; UE should then connect to rfsim server.
- If issues persist, validate PLMN consistency across CU/DU and UE, and confirm firewall/loopback allowances for SCTP and TCP (rfsim).


## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not show the explicit `gNB_ID` rejection line; CU does show a PLMN error. The analysis attributes the primary root cause to `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` per provided misconfigured_param, acknowledging there is also a PLMN misconfiguration that would independently cause exit.
- Full `network_config` JSON was not provided inline; snippets assume standard OAI fields inferred from logs. Adjust field names to match actual schema.
- No external spec lookup was required; guidance is based on typical OAI validation behavior and F1AP startup sequence. If needed, consult 3GPP TS 38.473 (F1AP) for identifier semantics and OAI configuration guides for valid ranges.
