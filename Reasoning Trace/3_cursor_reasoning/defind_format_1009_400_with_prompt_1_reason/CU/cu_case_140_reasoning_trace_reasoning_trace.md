## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Deployment mode**: Logs show SA mode with RF simulator (CU/DU: "--rfsim --sa"; UE tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`). This is the typical OAI SA rfsim setup: CU-CP (gNB-CU) + DU (gNB-DU) split with F1-C/SCTP between them, and a UE process connecting to the gNB rfsim server.
- **Expected bring-up flow**:
  1) CU initializes and listens for F1-C from DU; CU connects to AMF over NGAP.
  2) DU initializes PHY/MAC, starts rfsim server, and establishes F1-C SCTP to CU.
  3) UE connects to rfsim server, acquires SSB, decodes SIB1, and performs RACH → RRC → PDU session.
- **Given misconfiguration (guiding clue)**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - In NR/OAI, `gNB_ID` identifies a gNB node and is used in several layers:
    - RRC (SIB1 cell identity composition uses PLMN + gNB ID for `nrCellIdentity` bits).
    - F1AP/NGAP node identification and SCTP association contexts.
  - A value of `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits of 1) is out of spec for common encodings (often 20- or 22-bit gNB ID fields per 3GPP TS 38.413/38.300 family when composing `nrCellIdentity` of 36 bits: 28-bit gNB ID + 4-bit gNB DU ID, or 22-bit options depending on gNB ID length). OAI configurations typically use reasonable decimal IDs (e.g., 0, 1, 0x000000), while the logs show CU/DU internal IDs like 3584 for F1.
  - Hypothesis: An invalid `gNB_ID` causes inconsistent node identity encoding → CU fails to bind/accept F1 from DU or rejects association at SCTP/ASN.1 layer; DU retries SCTP connects; UE cannot connect to rfsim server because DU never fully activates radio.
- **Network config parsing**: Provided JSON includes `network_config` key by description, but the concrete `gnb_conf`/`ue_conf` objects are not included verbatim here. We infer key parameters from logs:
  - DU RRC: `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 → 3619200000 Hz`, `N_RB=106`, TDD pattern consistent (DL/UL slots). These align across DU and UE (UE set to same DL/UL frequency). No frequency mismatch.
  - F1 addresses: DU attempts F1-C to CU at `127.0.0.5` from `127.0.0.3`.
  - UE rfsim: tries `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly and fails (errno 111: connection refused), suggesting the DU’s rfsim server did not start listening (typically bound by DU after successful activation that depends on F1 Setup Response).

Initial mismatch indicators:
- DU stuck with repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` for F1-C to CU; CU logs do not show F1AP listener accepting connections or any F1 Setup transaction. This points to CU not ready/listening or rejecting due to configuration inconsistency (gNB identity is a prime suspect due to misconfigured `gNB_ID`).


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key CU lines:
- SA mode confirmed, OAI version printed, RAN context initialized with `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0`, `RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` (as expected for CU-CP-only).
- F1AP identifiers:
  - `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`
  - `F1AP: gNB_CU_name[0] gNB-Eurecom-CU`
- Security warning: `unknown integrity algorithm ""` (likely benign for bring-up; OAI often tolerates missing integrity for lab tests in rfsim).
- Config loading proceeds across `GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, etc.

What’s missing/anomalous:
- No indication that CU started SCTP listener for F1-C (no log like "F1AP CU listening"), nor any incoming SCTP from DU.
- No NGAP/AMF connection logs (but not essential yet).

Cross-reference to config:
- If `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is present in CU config, CU may internally fail to initialize valid F1AP node identity or AMF-side identities, possibly preventing F1-C from entering a valid listening/accept state or rejecting association upon INIT with parameter verification. CU logs are truncated before F1AP detailed states, but DU’s persistent refusal suggests CU side is not accepting SCTP.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Highlights:
- PHY/MAC/RRC initialized properly; spectrum config consistent with UE (3.6192 GHz, N_RB 106, mu=1, TDD patterns). No PHY assertion or PRACH errors seen.
- DU app prints `F1AP: Starting F1AP at DU` and attempts to connect F1-C: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3 → F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Then repeated:
  - `[SCTP]   Connect failed: Connection refused`
  - `[F1AP]   Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3) ... retrying...`
- DU prints `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` and does not proceed to activate RU/rfsim server fully for UE attachment.

Interpretation:
- Network path `127.0.0.5:38472` (typical SCTP port) seems to refuse connections: the CU either is not listening or is rejecting immediately.
- Given the guided misconfiguration, an invalid `gNB_ID` on either CU or DU (or mismatch between them) can cause F1 node identity mismatch and CU rejecting the association early.
- No DU-side PRACH/MIB/SIB generation failures are observed; the block is pre-radio-activation gated by missing F1 Setup Response.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Highlights:
- UE RF/Baseband aligns with DU: DL/UL 3.6192 GHz, TDD, N_RB 106.
- UE runs as rfsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails with `errno(111)`.

Interpretation and linkage:
- In rfsim, the DU usually starts the rfsim server (port ~4043 by default). Because DU is waiting for F1 Setup completion, it never brings up or keeps the rfsim server in an accept state, so the UE cannot connect. Thus, UE failures are downstream effects of DU’s F1-C issue.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU initializes but provides no evidence of F1 listener accepting connections.
- DU attempts to connect to CU over F1-C; SCTP connection refused repeatedly.
- UE cannot connect to rfsim server due to DU not activating radio pending F1 Setup Response.

Guided by misconfigured parameter:
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is an invalid or out-of-range node identity for 5G NR.
  - Per 3GPP (TS 38.413, TS 38.300, TS 38.331), gNB ID participates in constructing `nrCellIdentity` and in F1AP/NGAP identity IE constraints. OAI expects gNB ID values in valid bit-lengths (e.g., 20–28 bits depending on configuration) and consistent across CU and DU.
  - A value of `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) exceeds typical gNB ID bit-lengths, leading to either:
    - Failure to encode ASN.1 for F1AP Setup Request/Response or node identity structures.
    - Silent mis-initialization preventing listener setup.
    - Mismatch CU↔DU if only one side has the invalid value.

Root cause:
- The CU (and/or DU) `gNBs.gNB_ID` set to `0xFFFFFFFF` causes F1AP identity invalidation and results in CU refusing SCTP association from DU, observed as "connection refused" at the DU. Consequently, the DU never receives F1 Setup Response, does not activate radio/rfsim, and the UE cannot connect to the rfsim server.

Optional spec check (external knowledge):
- 3GPP TS 38.331 defines `nrCellIdentity` as 36 bits and `gNB-ID` with variable length options; practical implementations constrain gNB ID to fit the selected length (commonly 20 or 28 bits). Values must be within range; `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds typical allowed widths.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, modest value consistent across CU and DU, e.g., `0x000001` (decimal 1) or `3584` to align with the observed internal F1 ID. Ensure the same value in both CU and DU configs.
- Verify related identity fields:
  - `mcc`, `mnc`, `nci`/`nrCellIdentity` composition if explicitly configured.
  - F1-C IP/ports: CU should listen on `127.0.0.5`; DU connects from `127.0.0.3`. Ensure CU actually binds and runs.

Actionable config corrections as JSON snippets (illustrative — align with your actual `network_config` structure):

```json

    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- The key change is `gNBs.gNB_ID`: set to a valid integer within supported bit-length. Keep CU and DU in sync.
- After the change, expected behavior:
  1) CU starts F1AP listener and accepts DU SCTP association.
  2) DU receives F1 Setup Response, activates radio, starts/accepts rfsim connections.
  3) UE connects to `127.0.0.1:4043`, proceeds with SSB/SIB1, RACH, and RRC.

Further analysis and validation steps:
- Check CU logs for explicit F1AP listener start and F1 Setup handling after fix.
- If still failing, enable more verbose logs for F1AP/ASN.1 and verify SCTP port binding on CU.
- Confirm there are no conflicting `gNB_ID` values in multi-cell configs (if multiple gNB sections are used).


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; CU-side F1AP bind/listen messages and NGAP interactions are not shown, so we infer based on DU’s refused connects and the guided misconfiguration.
- The input JSON describes `network_config` but does not include the exact `gnb_conf`/`ue_conf` objects; config snippets above are illustrative and should be aligned with your actual schema.
- The exact allowed range for `gNB_ID` depends on chosen gNB-ID length configuration; ensure consistency with OAI’s `nrCellIdentity` composition. If your configuration explicitly sets gNB-ID bit length, select an ID that fits that width.
