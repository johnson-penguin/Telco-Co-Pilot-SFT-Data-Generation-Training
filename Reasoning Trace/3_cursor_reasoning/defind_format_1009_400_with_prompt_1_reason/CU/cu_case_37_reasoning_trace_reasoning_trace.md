## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Scenario**: OAI 5G NR Standalone using RFsim. CU and DU run as separate softmodems; UE runs as RFsim client. Logs show `--rfsim --sa` flags and typical init.
- **Expected flow**: Init → CU/DU F1AP association (SCTP) → CU NGAP to AMF (not shown) → DU radio activation → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB detect/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- **Provided inputs**:
  - **misconfigured_param**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (max 32-bit value).
  - **logs**: CU exits during config checks; DU retries SCTP to CU; UE repeatedly fails to connect to RFsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043.
  - **network_config**: Not present in JSON; infer typical OAI fields from logs (F1-C IPs, band/numerology, etc.).
- **Initial hypothesis (guided by misconfigured_param)**: `gNB_ID` is out of allowed range for OAI’s config validator (and/or violates 3GPP bit-length constraints for NR cell/global IDs). CU fails its `config_execcheck()` and exits. With CU down, the DU’s F1 SCTP connect is refused and the RFsim server never starts, causing UE RFsim client connect failures.

Key parameters inferred from logs:
- CU: F1AP CU id name present; fatal config check error before runtime. Also MNC is flagged invalid (`mnc: 9999999 invalid value`), compounding failure.
- DU: Band/numerology consistent (n78-ish, DL 3619.2 MHz, µ=1, N_RB=106). F1-C DU IP 127.0.0.3 to CU 127.0.0.5. Radio not activated due to missing F1 Setup Response.
- UE: RFsim client repeatedly attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 (server is not up because CU/DU stack did not fully start).

Conclusion of setup: A CU-side configuration error (notably `gNBs.gNB_ID` out-of-range, plus invalid MNC) aborts CU early, cascading to DU/UE symptoms.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode and begins reading config sections.
- Error: `config_check_intrange: mnc: 9999999 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999` followed by `config_execcheck: ... wrong value` and then `Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- There is no evidence of CU starting SCTP server for F1-C or NGAP; therefore, it terminates during configuration validation.
- Relevance to misconfigured_param: OAI’s `config_execcheck()` validates multiple fields. An out-of-range `gNBs.gNB_ID` (0xFFFFFFFF) would also be flagged. Even if the MNC error is prominent in the snippet, the misconfigured `gNB_ID` is a known cause to trip the same check and abort early.

Implication: CU never reaches an operational state; no F1 server, no RFsim server, no NGAP.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC successfully and prepares TDD patterns, frequencies, and GTP-U.
- F1AP client repeatedly tries SCTP to CU: `Connect failed: Connection refused` with automatic retries.
- DU log shows `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` — confirms DU radio remains inactive because CU is down.
- There are no PHY/MAC assertion failures; the block is purely control-plane connectivity (F1) blocked by CU termination.
- Cross-link to config: DU uses `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3` to `CU 127.0.0.5`. With CU not running, connections are refused.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes RF params consistent with DU (µ=1, N_RB=106, DL 3619.2 MHz, TDD). 
- UE is an RFsim client: `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` then repeated `connect() ... failed, errno(111)`.
- RFsim server is typically hosted by the gNB side. Because CU/DU stack is not fully up (CU aborted, DU blocked), the RFsim server socket is not listening, hence persistent connection refusals.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU terminates during configuration validation (before F1/NGAP), due to invalid fields. Given the provided misconfigured parameter, `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is outside the acceptable range enforced by OAI. The log also shows an invalid MNC, either of which would halt CU.
  - DU cannot complete F1 SCTP association to CU → retries with `Connection refused`.
  - UE’s RFsim client cannot connect to server → repeated errno(111) failures.
- Root cause (guided): The CU configuration contains an out-of-range `gNBs.gNB_ID` (and an invalid MNC). OAI’s config exec check halts the CU, blocking the rest of the system. The misconfigured `gNB_ID` aligns with known OAI constraints: the gNB ID is expected to fit within the bit-length used in 3GPP identifiers (commonly up to 28/32 bits but constrained by configuration and NCGI composition). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` violates OAI’s validator for the configured gNB ID field.
- External spec context (conceptual): In NR, the `gNB-ID` used within `NRCellGlobalId` is length-constrained; implementations like OAI further validate ranges to ensure interoperability. Oversized values cause early config rejection.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, smaller value (e.g., `0x00000001`).
- Fix PLMN values to valid ranges (e.g., `mnc` 2–3 digits, 0–999). The log showed `mnc: 9999999` which is invalid; correct it (e.g., `mcc=001, mnc=01, mnc_length=2`).

After changes, expected behavior:
- CU should pass `config_execcheck()`, start F1-C server, and listen for DU. 
- DU’s SCTP should connect; DU will receive F1 Setup Response, then activate radio.
- RFsim server will be up; UE RFsim client should connect, proceed to detect SSB, perform PRACH, and begin RRC attach.

Suggested corrected snippets (representative; adapt to your config structure):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "gNB_ID": "0x00000001", // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a valid small value
          "gNB_Name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
          "plmn_list": [
            { "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01", "mnc_length": 2 } // fixed MNC range
          ],
          "F1AP": {
            "gNB_CU_id": 3584,
            "CU_F1C_IPv4": "127.0.0.5"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
      "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
      "dl_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
      "ul_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
      "numerology": 1,
      "dl_bandwidth_rb": 106
    }
  }
}
```

Follow-up validation steps:
- Re-run CU with config; ensure no `config_execcheck` errors.
- Confirm CU listens on F1-C (netstat/ss) and logs `F1 Setup Request/Response` with DU.
- Verify UE connects to RFsim server (no more errno 111), observe SSB sync and RRC procedures in logs.

## 7. Limitations
- The provided JSON lacks the explicit `network_config` object; corrections above assume standard OAI fields deduced from logs. 
- CU logs highlight an invalid MNC, which independently causes failure; while the task centers on `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, both must be corrected to proceed.
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; the reasoning correlates by sequence and typical OAI behavior rather than precise timing.
