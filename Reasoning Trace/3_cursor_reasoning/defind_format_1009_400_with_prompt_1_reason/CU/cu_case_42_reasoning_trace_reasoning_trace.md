## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We analyze an OAI 5G NR SA setup using rfsim. Expected flow: CU init → NGAP to AMF → F1AP with DU → SIB/PRACH/RRC → UE reaches RRC_CONNECTED → NAS Registration → PDU session setup. The provided misconfigured parameter is `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In NGAP, the Global gNB ID contains PLMN and a gNB-ID whose macro form is limited in bit-length (commonly up to 22 bits). Values outside this range require bit-length signaling and proper masking/encoding; extreme values risk truncation/collisions.

From logs and inferred config:
- CU runs SA with rfsim; DU connects over F1; UE reaches RRC_CONNECTED and Registration Accept.
- CU logs show: `Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584` and `3584 -> 0000e000` (an encoded macro gNB-ID value). This differs from `0xFFFFFFFF`, implying OAI masked/overrode the configured `gNB_ID` to a smaller in-range macro id (3584) for NGAP/F1AP.
- CU also shows invalid GTP-U IP `999.999.999.999`, later causing CU-UP/E1 failure and an assertion in `e1_bearer_context_setup()` when establishing NG-U for the PDU session.

Takeaway: the target issue is the misconfigured `gNB_ID`. Even though the run proceeds (OAI appears to sanitize to 3584), this non-compliant value can lead to ambiguous NGAP encoding, ID collisions, or inter-node mismatch if sanitation differs between CU and DU. We will diagnose with that lens while acknowledging the separate fatal GTP-U misconfig observed.

Relevant network_config (extracted/implicit):
- gnb_conf: `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, NGAP/AMF IP present (192.168.8.43), GTP-U local address set erroneously to `999.999.999.999` (from logs).
- ue_conf: typical SA/rfsim settings; UE attaches and exchanges NAS, so UE-side RF and PLMN are fine.

Initial mismatch: configured `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` vs runtime macro gNB id 3584 in logs.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode/threads: SA mode, NGAP/F1AP/RRC tasks started. AMF IP parsed `192.168.8.43`. NGSetupRequest/Response succeeds.
- NGAP identity: `Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584`; `3584 -> 0000e000` indicates encoded macro ID value. This suggests masking/truncation from configured `0xFFFFFFFF`.
- F1AP: DU F1 Setup Request received and accepted; DU RRC version 17.3.0; cell in service.
- RRC/NAS: UE context created; RRC Setup/Complete; security configured; capabilities exchanged; NGAP InitialContextSetup handled; PDU session setup initiated.
- Anomalies:
  - NGAP IE warning: `could not find NGAP_ProtocolIE_ID_id_UEAggregateMaximumBitRate` (non-fatal, common in some OAI builds).
  - GTP-U: Invalid address `999.999.999.999` → `getaddrinfo error` → CUUP N3 listener failure → later `try to get a gtp-u not existing output` and assertion in `cucp_cuup_handler.c:198` during E1 bearer context setup. This explains the ultimate crash at PDU session setup time (user plane not instantiated).

Mapping to config: `gNB_ID` mismatch is visible (3584 used at runtime). The fatal condition is orthogonal (bad GTP-U IP), but `gNB_ID` remains non-compliant and risky.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU MAC stats show stable UL/DL HARQ, BLER dropping, UE RNTI 53ef in-sync — PHY/MAC healthy.
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with F1AP retry messages occur intermittently, but CU also logs successful F1 setup earlier; these may reflect transient reconnections around CU errors.
- No PRACH/MIB/SIB PHY errors; no `assert` in DU. Nothing directly pointing to `gNB_ID`, but if CU and DU interpret/mask `gNB_ID` differently, F1 identity could diverge. Here both sides display 3584, suggesting consistent masking.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE processes SecurityModeCommand, UECapabilityEnquiry, Registration Accept; prints 5G-GUTI; sends RegistrationComplete and PDU Session Establishment Request.
- UE MAC stats progress normally; no RF or timing issues.
- No evidence of issues attributable to `gNB_ID` from UE perspective; failure occurs at PDU session stage due to CU user-plane setup crash.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: Control plane is fine (NGAP up, RRC Connected, Registration Accept). Failure occurs when establishing NG-U/E1 bearers due to the invalid GTP-U IP, causing `gtpu instance id: -1`, then E1 setup assertion on CU.
- `gNB_ID` misconfiguration analysis (guided by misconfigured_param):
  - Spec-wise, NGAP Global gNB ID includes a gNB-ID with constrained bit length (macro form commonly ≤22 bits). A configured value of `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds macro-ID bit capacity; OAI likely masks to an implementation-defined width, yielding 3584 here. Such sanitation can lead to:
    - Non-deterministic IDs across builds/configs (if mask differs),
    - Collisions with other gNBs if multiple nodes end up with the same truncated ID,
    - AMF identity management inconsistencies when enc/decoding NGSetup/NGReset/F1Setup.
  - In these logs, both CU and DU report macro id 3584, so the system proceeds. However, the configuration remains non-compliant and brittle.
- Therefore:
  - Immediate crash cause: invalid GTP-U address configuration on CU (user-plane), independent of `gNB_ID`.
  - Root cause per task’s misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is out-of-range for macro gNB-ID; OAI masks it, risking identity inconsistencies. It should be set within the valid macro-ID range and kept consistent between CU and DU configs to avoid NGAP/F1 identity issues.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Mandatory config fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid macro gNB-ID value within the supported bit-length (e.g., a small decimal like 1–4094 or any value fitting your deployment’s ID plan). Example: `0x00000E00` (3584) if you intend to match the current runtime, or `0x00000001` for a minimal value. Ensure CU and DU use the same value.
- Fix the GTP-U local address to a valid IP reachable by CU-UP/E1 and the UPF. The `999.999.999.999` entry must be replaced with a real local interface IP (e.g., `127.0.0.5` for rfsim local testing or your LAN IP).

Suggested corrected `network_config` snippets (JSON objects):
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNB_ID": "0x00000E00",  // set to 3584 explicitly; within macro gNB-ID range
      "ngap": {
        "amf_ipv4": "192.168.8.43"
      },
      "gtpu": {
        "local_addr": "127.0.0.5",  // was 999.999.999.999; use valid local IP for rfsim
        "port": 2152
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No changes needed for this issue; UE successfully registered
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after change:
- Restart CU/DU/UE; verify CU logs show the intended macro gNB id (e.g., 3584) without sanitation differences.
- Confirm NGSetup and F1Setup succeed; then verify `GTPU Created gtpu instance id` is non-negative and no CUUP listener failures occur.
- From AMF/UPF perspective, check that Global gNB ID is consistent and PDU session completes with GTP-U tunnel created.

If you need a smaller ID:
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNB_ID": "0x00000001"
    }
  }
}
```

Further analysis ideas:
- Inspect OAI’s NGAP encoding for GlobalGNB-ID and the internal mask applied to `gNB_ID` to guarantee compliance across nodes.
- Add config validation: reject `gNB_ID` values exceeding supported bit length to prevent silent truncation.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated; exact `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` not fully shown. We infer `gNB_ID` and GTP-U IP from logs.
- We did not fetch spec clauses here; conclusion relies on common NGAP practice that macro gNB-ID uses a limited bit-length and OAI’s typical masking behavior.
- The immediate crash is due to invalid GTP-U IP; the task’s designated misconfiguration (`gNB_ID`) did not trigger a visible crash in these logs but remains a standards-compliance and robustness issue that should be corrected.
