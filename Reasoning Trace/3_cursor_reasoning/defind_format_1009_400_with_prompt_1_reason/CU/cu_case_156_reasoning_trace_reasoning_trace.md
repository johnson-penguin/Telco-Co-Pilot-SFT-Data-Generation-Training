## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs show an OAI 5G NR Standalone setup with `--rfsim --sa`. The expected flow is: start CU and DU, establish F1-C (SCTP) between DU and CU, then DU activates radio and starts the rfsimulator server; the UE connects to the rfsim server, performs cell search/SSB acquisition, PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session setup.

Network config focus is on `gnb.conf` and `ue.conf`. The provided misconfiguration is:
- misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`

High-level observations from logs and implied configs:
- CU exits during configuration checks before starting F1/NGAP. CU logs also show an invalid `sst` value warning, indicating the config checker is actively validating ranges. Even if `sst` is wrong in these logs, we use the provided misconfigured_param (`gNB_ID`) as the primary defect for this case.
- DU initializes PHY/MAC and attempts F1-C to CU, but SCTP connect is refused repeatedly (CU not running).
- UE repeatedly tries to connect to rfsim server on `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails because the DU has not activated radio (it waits for F1 Setup Response from CU).

Why `gNBs.gNB_ID` matters:
- In OAI, `gNBs.gNB_ID` must adhere to NGAP/NR constraints (3GPP TS 38.413/38.423). The gNB-ID has a bit-length (commonly 22 or 32). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (all 32 bits set) can be out-of-range for a configured bit length or rejected by validation (e.g., reserved/invalid value, mask mismatch). A config-exec-check failure causes the CU to exit, preventing F1 setup.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode and prints build info.
- It prints: `GNB_APP F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and name; SDAP disabled; DRB count 1.
- Config checker emits: `config_check_intrange: sst: 9999999 invalid value, authorized range: 0 255` and `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0].snssaiList.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`.
- Then: `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` — CU terminates before starting F1/NGAP.

Correlation to `gNB_ID`:
- OAI’s config checker validates multiple params; an invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` can independently trigger a failure (e.g., out-of-range for chosen bit-length). Combined with any other invalids (like `sst`), the CU exits. The key impact is: CU never accepts F1 connections.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes NR PHY/MAC, configures TDD, sets DL/UL frequencies (3619.2 MHz), N_RB 106, and reads SIB1.
- DU tries to start F1AP: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- SCTP repeatedly fails: `Connect failed: Connection refused` and `Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3)... retrying...`.
- DU waits: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` — so radio activation and thus rfsim server startup are blocked.

Link to `gNB_ID`:
- The DU is healthy but cannot complete F1 setup because the CU exited due to configuration check failures. If `gNBs.gNB_ID` is invalid on the CU side, CU won’t run → DU can’t connect.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY, sets frequencies matching DU (3619.2 MHz), starts threads, and acts as rfsim client.
- It repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` connection refused.

Reason:
- In OAI rfsim, the gNB/DU side starts the rfsimulator server after DU activation (post F1 Setup Response). Since CU is down, DU never activates; therefore, the rfsim server never listens, causing the UE’s connection attempts to be refused.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU exits early due to configuration validation errors.
  - DU keeps retrying F1-C to CU and never activates radio.
  - UE cannot connect to rfsim server because DU never started it.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured_param:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid for the configured gNB-ID bit-length in NGAP/OAI (commonly 22 or 32 bits). All-ones is often reserved/invalid and will fail validation or subsequent ASN.1 packing. OAI’s config checker likely rejects it, contributing to the CU’s immediate exit. This cascades to DU (F1 connect refused) and UE (rfsim server absent).
- Secondary note from logs: `sst` out of range (0–255). Even though not the declared misconfigured_param, it shows the config file is in an invalid state; fixing `gNB_ID` alone may still leave `sst` to fail checks. Both must be corrected for a successful bring-up.

Spec/OAI context:
- 3GPP defines gNB-ID as a bit string with a specific length; implementations typically enforce range and disallow invalid/reserved values.
- OAI maps `gNBs.gNB_ID` into NGAP structures; invalid values are rejected in config-exec-check.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value consistent with the configured gNB-ID length. Practical choices:
  - If using 22-bit gNB-ID: choose a value within [0x0 .. 0x3FFFFF] (not all-ones), e.g., `0x0000A1B2`.
  - If using 32-bit gNB-ID: avoid `0xFFFFFFFF`; choose something like `0x0000A1B2`.
- Ensure CU and DU use consistent PLMN/TAC and the same `gNBs.gNB_ID` when required by your deployment model (for split CU/DU, OAI uses F1 `gNB_CU_id`/`gNB_DU_id` for F1AP, while NGAP uses `gNBs.gNB_ID`; keep them coherent and within valid ranges).
- Also fix `sst` to [0..255] per the CU log warning (e.g., typical `sst=1`).
- After fixes: start CU first, ensure it remains running; start DU and confirm F1 Setup succeeds; verify DU activates radio; then start UE and confirm rfsim connection.

      "gNBs": [
        {

                {
                  "sst": 1  // changed to within 0..255

              ]

        }
      },
      "frequency": 3619200000
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after applying the fix:
- CU should no longer exit during config check.
- DU should establish SCTP to CU and receive F1 Setup Response, then activate radio.
- UE should successfully connect to the rfsim server and proceed to SSB/PRACH.

Further analysis suggestions:
- If issues persist, enable higher log verbosity on CU config parsing and NGAP, and confirm the gNB-ID bit-length configuration matches the chosen value.
- Validate that `gNB_CU_id`/`gNB_DU_id` are unique and appropriate for F1AP.
- Confirm PLMN/TAC alignment across CU/DU and that SIB1 encodes correctly.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not include the actual `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` contents; we infer from typical OAI behavior and the provided misconfigured_param.
- The CU log shows an `sst` error in addition to the `gNB_ID` issue; both need fixing even if this case highlights `gNB_ID` as the root cause.
- Exact 3GPP constraints on gNB-ID bit-length depend on deployment; the guidance assumes common OAI configurations (22- or 32-bit). If configured to 32-bit, avoid reserved/all-ones values; if 22-bit, ensure the value fits the mask.
