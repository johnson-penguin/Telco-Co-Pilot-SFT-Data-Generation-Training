## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

We are analyzing an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone deployment running with the RF simulator (`--rfsim --sa`). The expected bring-up flow is: process start → configuration parse → CU initializes NGAP/E1/F1 control-plane → DU initializes PHY/MAC and F1-C towards CU → CU-DU complete F1 Setup → DU activates radio/rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server → SIB/SSB decoding → PRACH/RA → RRC attach and PDU session.

The provided `misconfigured_param` is `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. The CU logs show an assertion in `RCconfig_NR_CU_E1()` reporting that `gNB_ID` is not defined/valid. The DU logs show repeated SCTP connection refusals when attempting F1-C to the CU (`127.0.0.5`). The UE logs show repeated failures connecting to the rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043`.

From the implicit network configuration:
- In `gnb_conf`, `gNBs.gNB_ID` is set to `0xFFFFFFFF` (the misconfiguration). Other CU parameters (e.g., AMF IP `192.168.8.43`) are parsed.
- In `ue_conf`, typical rfsim client settings point to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial mismatch: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid for OAI’s NG RAN node ID handling. In NGAP, the gNB ID is a BIT STRING with a size range (22..32) per 3GPP TS 38.413, but OAI’s configuration/validation expects a sane, bounded value. Using the all-ones value triggers the CU-side config assertion and aborts bring-up.

What to look for downstream: CU abort prevents F1 Setup → DU cannot activate radio or rfsim server → UE cannot connect to rfsim server and loops on TCP connection attempts.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode/version/init:
  - SA mode confirmed.
  - RAN context initialized; CU-specific threads (SCTP, NGAP, RRC) created.
  - AMF IP parsed (`192.168.8.43`).
- Critical failure:
  - `Assertion (config_isparamset(gnbParms, 0)) failed!` in `RCconfig_NR_CU_E1()` with message `gNB_ID is not defined in configuration file`.
  - This is OAI’s guard that the `gNB_ID` parameter is present and valid (not merely syntactically present). The value `0xFFFFFFFF` is treated as invalid/reserved, so the CU exits immediately.
- Consequence:
  - NGAP/E1/F1 setup cannot proceed. No listener for DU’s F1-C, so any DU attempt to associate will be refused.

Cross-reference to config:
- Misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID` is the direct trigger of the CU abort. All other CU log lines are consistent with normal pre-config stages.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- Mode/init:
  - SA mode confirmed; PHY/MAC initialized, TDD config, frequencies (DL/UL 3619.2 MHz), N_RB=106.
  - DU prepares F1AP and GTPU, and sets F1-C DU IP `127.0.0.3` to connect to CU at `127.0.0.5`.
- Key event:
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` for F1-C association, followed by retry messages.
  - `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` indicates DU will not start radio and thus will not act as rfsim server until F1 Setup completes.
- Consequence:
  - Because the CU crashed on config assertion, F1-C on CU is not up; the DU cannot complete F1 Setup and therefore keeps the radio inactive.

Cross-reference to config:
- The DU path is healthy; the refusal originates remotely (the CU), aligning with the CU crash caused by invalid `gNB_ID`.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- Mode/init:
  - UE initializes PHY with matching numerology and frequency (3619.2 MHz, N_RB=106), and starts rfsim client.
- Key event:
  - Repeated attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` fail with `errno(111)` (connection refused). This is expected if the rfsim server is not up.
- Consequence:
  - Without a running DU radio/rfsim server (blocked behind F1 Setup), UE cannot proceed to SSB/SIB decoding, RA, or RRC attach.

Cross-reference to config:
- UE side looks consistent; the failure is environmental: the rfsim server is absent because the DU is waiting on F1 which is blocked by the CU crash.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU aborts at configuration stage due to invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- DU cannot establish F1-C to CU (`127.0.0.5`), receives connection refused, and therefore does not activate radio.
- UE repeatedly fails to connect to the rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` because DU’s radio/rfsim server was never started.

Root cause:
- The misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is rejected by OAI’s CU configuration validator (NG RAN node ID handling). This prevents CU startup, cascading to DU F1 failure and UE rfsim connection failure.

Standards/code reasoning:
- NGAP `gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING with constrained size; OAI requires a valid, non-reserved integer value that fits its internal encoding/bit-length expectations. Using the all-ones value is a known anti-pattern and often reserved/sentinel in code paths. A small, unique value (e.g., `0x00000001`) is standard practice in OAI examples and satisfies both encoding and uniqueness requirements.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate fix (CU `gnb.conf`):
- Set a valid, non-reserved `gNBs.gNB_ID`. Use a small unique value, e.g., `0x00000001`.
- Ensure CU/DU F1 addresses align with your topology (`127.0.0.5` for CU F1-C, `127.0.0.3` for DU F1-C, as per logs).

Suggested corrected snippets (JSON-like for clarity):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000001", // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a valid small ID
        "gNB_CU": {
          "F1AP": {
            "CU_f1c_address": "127.0.0.5" // ensure CU listens here
          }
        },
        "gNB_DU": {
          "F1AP": {
            "DU_f1c_address": "127.0.0.3", // DU source IP in logs
            "CU_f1c_address": "127.0.0.5"  // DU target IP in logs
          }
        }
      },
      "AMF": {
        "ipv4": "192.168.8.43" // matches CU log parsing
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", // UE connects locally to DU rfsim server
        "serverport": 4043          // matches UE log target port
      },
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational validation steps:
- Restart CU first; confirm no assertion on `gNB_ID` and that NGAP listens.
- Start DU; verify F1 Setup completes (no SCTP refused). DU log should transition past “waiting for F1 Setup Response” and activate radio.
- Start UE; confirm TCP connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, SSB detection, SIB decode, PRACH/RA, then RRC attach.

Deeper checks if issues persist:
- Verify that the configured `gNB_ID` bit-length aligns with OAI build defaults (some builds use 20/22-bit masks for macro IDs). Small IDs avoid boundary behaviors.
- Ensure no duplicate `gNB_ID` if multiple CUs are present.
- Confirm local firewall/SELinux not blocking SCTP/TCP ports used by F1/NGAP/rfsim in your environment.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and without timestamps; fine-grained timing correlation is inferred.
- The full `network_config` objects are not exhaustively provided; snippets above assume defaults consistent with the logs.
- Standards note: NGAP `gNB-ID` encoding (TS 38.413) allows 22..32 bits; OAI configuration still requires a valid, bounded integer that fits its internal representation. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (all ones) commonly trips validation and should be avoided.
