## 5G NR / OAI Reasoning Trace Generation Prompt

## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The system is running OAI NR in SA mode with RFsim based on CU/DU/UE logs showing "--rfsim --sa" and RF simulator connection attempts.
- Expected bring-up: CU initializes and exposes F1-C listener → DU connects via SCTP and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio → UE connects to RFsim server, performs SSB sync/PRACH → RRC attach → (optionally) PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: "gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF". This value is outside valid NR gNB ID ranges (gNB ID is up to 22 bits depending on nci bits; 0xFFFFFFFF is 32 bits all-ones). Such an out-of-range ID typically leads to configuration parsing failures or sanity-check rejections in OAI, which can prevent CU from starting F1-C and other tasks dependent on a valid RAN identity.
- Network configuration summary (inferred from logs):
  - gNB frequencies: DL/UL 3619200000 Hz (n78-style TDD), N_RB=106, μ=1, TDD period index=6 with 8 DL + 3 UL slots per 10-slot pattern.
  - DU side shows TAC=1 and cellID 1; CU shows a computed/printed `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`. This mismatch with the provided misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` suggests the config provided to the tool is erroneous and likely caused CU to not finalize F1AP initialization even if a fallback/derived ID was logged.
- Initial mismatch hints:
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (connection refused), indicating CU is not listening on F1-C. This aligns with CU potentially not creating F1 task due to invalid `gNB_ID`.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, consistent with DU not activating radio because F1 Setup never completes.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Key lines:
  - "[GNB_APP] Initialized RAN Context: ... RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0, RC.nb_RU = 0": CU-only context (no MAC/L1/RU, as expected for CU).
  - "F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584": A gNB CU ID is printed, but importantly, we see no subsequent F1-C listener creation, SCTP server binds, or NGAP/AMF logs.
  - "unknown ciphering algorithm \"nea9\"" warning: non-fatal; OAI supports nea0/nea1/nea2. This alone shouldn’t block F1.
  - Multiple "Reading 'GNBSParams' section" messages indicate config parsing.
- Anomalies:
  - Absence of lines like "Starting F1AP at CU" or "SCTP listening on ..." suggests CU never initialized F1-C.
  - Given the misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, a plausible path is that CU config validation failed silently or prevented F1 task creation.
- Cross-reference:
  - DU attempts F1-C connect to CU 127.0.0.5; CU never logs F1 listener, matching DU "connection refused".

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Initialization is healthy through PHY/MAC setup: frequencies, numerology, TDD, antenna ports, SIB1 parameters, etc.
- F1AP client side:
  - "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5" followed by repeated "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" → CU not listening.
  - DU reports "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" → DU does not bring up the RFsim server for UE until F1 Setup completes.
- No PHY asserts or PRACH errors; blockage is at F1 setup due to CU side unavailable.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY correctly for DL=UL=3619200000 Hz, N_RB=106, μ=1, TDD.
- RFsim client behavior:
  - "Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side" and repeated attempts to 127.0.0.1:4043 with errno(111) (connection refused) → no server listening.
- This aligns with DU not activating radio (server side) because F1 setup to CU didn’t complete.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU parses config and does not start F1-C listener → DU’s SCTP to CU is refused → DU stays in pre-activation state → RFsim server is not started → UE cannot connect to RFsim server and loops connection attempts.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured parameter:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid (exceeds allowed bit-width). OAI typically enforces gNB ID ranges tied to the 5G NR cell global ID structure. An invalid gNB ID can cause CU-side configuration validation to fail and inhibit F1AP initialization, producing exactly the DU and UE symptoms observed.
- Sanity with observed IDs:
  - Logs show `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` on CU and `gNB_DU_id 3584` on DU, indicating that when valid, both sides use a consistent small ID. With `0xFFFFFFFF`, CU likely rejects/never binds F1, hence refusal seen by DU.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix:
  - Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, consistent value across CU and DU (e.g., 3584 as per DU log, or any value within valid range, typically ≤ 2^22-1 when full 22-bit gNB ID is used). Ensure `plmn`, `nci` composition (gNB ID + cell ID bits) remains consistent with SIB/ServingCellConfigCommon.
  - Replace unsupported ciphering algorithm `nea9` with a supported one (e.g., `nea2`) to avoid later RRC security issues, though this is not the blocker here.
- Further checks:
  - After fixing, verify CU logs contain F1-C listener startup and DU receives F1 Setup Response, then confirm DU activates radio and UE connects to RFsim server.
  - Confirm NGAP/AMF configuration if running core network; otherwise RFsim-only attach will proceed through RRC and MAC.

- Corrected config snippets (representative within `network_config`):
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      // Changed from 0xFFFFFFFF (invalid) to 3584 (valid example)
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": 3584,
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom",
        "plmn_list": [{ "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" }]
      },
      // Ensure CU/DU share the same ID and related cell parameters
      "cell": {
        "tac": 1,

        "dl_carrier_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_carrier_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "ssbSubcarrierSpacing": 30,
        "nrb_dl": 106
      },
      // Use supported algorithms
      "security": {
        "ciphering_algorithms": ["nea2"],
        "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2"]
      },
      "f1ap": {
        "cu_f1c_bind_addr": "127.0.0.5",
        "du_connect_allow": true
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change required for frequencies; keep aligned with gNB
      "rf": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
        "dl_carrier_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_carrier_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "ssbSubcarrierSpacing": 30,
        "nrb_dl": 106
      },
      "plmn": { "mcc": "001", "mnc": "01" }
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and CU logs do not explicitly show an error for invalid `gNB_ID`; the diagnosis leverages the provided misconfigured parameter and observed behavior (no F1 listener on CU, DU connection refused, UE RFsim connection refused) to form a consistent root cause.
- Exact 3GPP bit allocation between gNB ID and cell ID depends on configuration (nci length); ensure chosen `gNB_ID` respects total bit constraints (commonly ≤ 2^22-1 when using 10-bit cell ID) and matches OAI expectations.
