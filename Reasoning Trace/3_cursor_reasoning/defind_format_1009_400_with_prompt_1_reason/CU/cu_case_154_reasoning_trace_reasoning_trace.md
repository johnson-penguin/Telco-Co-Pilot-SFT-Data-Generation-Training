## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The setup is OAI NR SA over rfsim: CU/DU logs include "--rfsim --sa"; the UE repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (rfsim TCP server hosted by the gNB process).
- Expected bring-up sequence: CU config OK ??CU starts F1-C/SCTP and rfsim server ??DU connects F1-C to CU ??cell configured (TDD, SIB1) ??UE connects to rfsim server ??SSB detect ??PRACH ??RRC setup ??PDU session. None of the access procedures occur here.
- Provided misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - In 5G, the gNB ID signaled in NGAP/F1AP is size-limited (commonly 22 bits for NG-RAN gNB ID; max `0x3FFFFF`). `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit) exceeds this range and is rejected by OAI? config validator.
- Network configuration cues from logs:
  - CU: starts reading `GNBSParams`, then the config checker flags PLMN issues (invalid `mnc`), and exits early via `config_execcheck()`.
  - DU: consistent RF settings (n78 @ 3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, TDD index 6), attempts F1-C to CU at `127.0.0.5` from `127.0.0.3` but gets `Connection refused` repeatedly.
  - UE: RF matches DU and repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)`.
- Initial mismatch highlights:
  - CU exits during config validation ??there? no CU F1-C/SCTP listener and no rfsim server.
  - DU? F1-C connection attempts are refused (no server on CU side).
  - UE? rfsim TCP attempts are refused (no gNB rfsim server up).
  - The supplied misconfigured `gNB_ID` is sufficient to cause this CU exit path; logs additionally show an invalid `mnc`, implying multiple config errors co-exist.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key observations:
- CU prints: `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and CU name, then config checker errors: `config_check_intrange: mnc: 9999999 invalid value` followed by `config_execcheck()` exit.
- The command line shows `--rfsim --sa -O .../cu_case_154.conf` and the config sections being read (`GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, etc.).
Interpretation:
- CU starts, parses config, and fails during `config_execcheck()` (fatal). This occurs before starting F1AP/SCTP or rfsim.
- Even though the log explicitly flags `mnc` out of range, the provided misconfigured parameter (`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`) independently violates OAI? allowed range and would trigger the same fatal check. Any one such error is sufficient for the observed behavior.
Cross-reference to config:
- `gNBs.gNB_ID` must fit the supported bit length (??`0x3FFFFF` is a safe bound in typical OAI profiles). Values like `3584` (`0xE00`) are used elsewhere in the logs and are valid. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` forces early termination.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Key observations:
- PHY/MAC initialization is nominal: n78, DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, 106 PRBs, proper TDD configuration; SIB1 and RRC common config parsed; DU F1AP startup logged.
- DU repeatedly logs: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and retries F1-C association, while printing `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
Interpretation:
- DU is healthy up to F1AP. `Connection refused` indicates no SCTP listener at the CU endpoint?onsistent with CU exiting on config validation.
- There are no PHY/MAC assertion failures (no PRACH errors, etc.); DU is simply blocked by absent CU.
Link to misconfiguration:
- The DU issue is downstream: CU never reaches F1-C bring-up because of the invalid `gNB_ID` (and invalid MNC), so DU cannot connect.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Key observations:
- UE initializes with RF matching the DU (3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, TDD), spawns threads, and runs as rfsim client.
- Repeated TCP attempts to `127.0.0.1:4043` fail with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
Interpretation:
- In rfsim, the gNB process hosts the server at port 4043. Since the CU process exits during config validation, no rfsim server exists; thus UE? connection attempts fail. RF settings themselves are coherent.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Correlation timeline:
- CU fails configuration checks and exits before networking: no F1-C/SCTP listener; no rfsim server.
- DU tries F1-C to CU and gets connection refused repeatedly.
- UE tries rfsim to the gNB server and gets connection refused repeatedly.
Root cause (guided by misconfigured_param):
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds allowable range for OAI/NGAP gNB ID (commonly 22 bits, max `0x3FFFFF`). OAI? `config_execcheck()` aborts.
- The CU log also shows invalid `mnc`, indicating multiple config errors; but the supplied misconfigured `gNB_ID` alone explains the system-wide failure pattern.
Resulting effect chain:
- Invalid gNB_ID ??CU aborts ??DU F1-C refused ??UE rfsim refused ??no attach or radio procedures occur.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within range. Reuse a known-good value seen in logs, e.g., `3584` (`0xE00`). Ensure it fits ??`0x3FFFFF`.
Secondary fixes/validations:
- Correct PLMN: `mcc` ??[0,999], `mnc` ??[0,999] and consistent `mnc_length`. The CU log shows `mnc` invalid; fix this too.
- Verify F1-C addressing: DU `127.0.0.3` ??CU `127.0.0.5` must match CU bind/listen IP; ensure SCTP allowed by firewall.
- Confirm UE? `rfsimulator_serveraddr` points to the CU/gNB host IP (often `127.0.0.1`) and port 4043.

Proposed corrected configuration snippets (embedded in the expected `network_config` shape):
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": 3584,
        "note": "Changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to 3584 (0xE00). Must be ??0x3FFFFF."
      },
      "plmn_list": {
        "mcc": 1,
        "mnc": 1,
        "mnc_length": 2,
        "note": "Fixed invalid MNC. Ensure PLMN values are within 0??99 and consistent."
      }
      /* other gNB parameters (TDD, bands, TAC, AMF/F1 IPs) remain as in baseline */
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "n_rb_dl": 106
      },
      "rfsim": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043
      }
      /* ensure IMSI PLMN matches gNB PLMN (001/01 here) */
    }
  }
}
```
Operational validation steps:
- Start CU; verify no `config_execcheck()` aborts. Confirm F1-C listener and rfsim server bind (look for SCTP listen and rfsim port 4043 in logs; `ss -lnp | findstr 4043` / check Windows equivalent or WSL).
- Start DU; expect successful SCTP association and F1 Setup Response; radio activation proceeds.
- Start UE; expect successful TCP connect to rfsim server, SSB detection, PRACH, RRC setup.
If issues persist:
- Increase log levels for CONFIG/F1AP/SCTP/RRC.
- Re-check CU bind IP vs DU `remote_address` for F1-C.
- Validate PLMN/TAI consistency and AMF reachability if NGAP is involved.


## 7. Limitations
- The exact `gnb_conf`/`ue_conf` JSON is not fully provided; fixes are shown as examples aligned with observed logs. The invalid MNC indicates further fields may need correction.
- gNB ID bit length can vary by profile; using `??0x3FFFFF` is a safe OAI practice for NG-RAN gNB ID. Consult your OAI version? validator for precise limits.
- Diagnosis relies on the supplied misconfigured parameter and correlates strongly with the cross-component symptoms (CU abort ??DU/UE connection refused).
