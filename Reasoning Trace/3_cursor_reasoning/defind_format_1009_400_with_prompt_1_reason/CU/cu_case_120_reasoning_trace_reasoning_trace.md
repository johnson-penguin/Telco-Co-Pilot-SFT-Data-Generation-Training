## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
**Scenario**: OAI 5G NR SA with rfsim. CU runs NGAP toward AMF and F1AP toward DU; DU runs MAC/PHY; UE attaches via RA → RRC → NAS Registration → PDU session.

**Key cues from logs**
- CU: "running in SA mode", NGSetupRequest/Response with AMF, F1AP startup, F1 Setup from DU, full RRC signaling with UE, then crash when creating GTP tunnel (CU-UP/E1 interface errors).
- DU: MAC running fine with one UE (RNTI 0cab), repeated F1AP SCTP association retries after CU crashes (connection refused).
- UE: Completes RRC Security, Capability exchange, receives Registration Accept, sends PDU Session Establishment Request; UE MAC stats continue.

**Misconfigured parameter (given)**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.

**Expectation**: In NGAP, the `gNB-ID` is encoded with a chosen bit length (22..32 bits per 3GPP TS 38.413/36.413-like NGAP constructs). OAI often uses a 22-bit macro gNB-ID for macro cells. Setting `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits all-ones) does not fit a 22-bit allocation and can overflow or be masked inconsistently across CU/DU and F1/NGAP paths, leading to identity mismatches and control-plane failures.

**Network config parsing**: The input does not include a full `network_config` object, but from CU logs we see:
- CU registers macro gNB id 3584 and prints mapping: `3584 -> 0000e000`.
- Therefore, the operative gNB-ID in the running system is 3584 (22-bit macro encoding), not `0xFFFFFFFF`.

Initial mismatch: configured `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` vs runtime/NGAP `gNB_ID=3584`.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Initialization: SA mode; threads for SCTP/NGAP/RRC; AMF IP parsed `192.168.8.43`; GTPU configured.
- NGAP: `Send NGSetupRequest` → `Received NGSetupResponse` OK.
- F1AP: `Starting F1AP at CU`; `Received F1 Setup Request from gNB_DU 3584` → `Accepting DU 3584` OK.
- RRC: UE context created for RNTI 0cab; RRCSetup, SecurityMode, UECapability, InitialContextSetup progress; PDU Session Resource Setup starts.
- Errors preceding crash:
  - `GTPU getaddrinfo error ... can't create GTP-U instance` → `Created gtpu instance id: -1` (initial failure with unspecified local address, later a valid local 127.0.0.5 instance 94 appears; mixed signals).
  - `E1AP Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener` (CU-CP↔CU-UP path problem).
  - On PDU session handling: `try to get a gtp-u not existing output` → assertion:
    - `Assertion (ret >= 0) failed! In e1_bearer_context_setup() ... Unable to create GTP Tunnel for NG-U` → softmodem exits.

Interpretation: Control plane up to RRC/NAS works; data plane setup (E1/NG-U GTP-U) fails and triggers exit. Identity/config inconsistencies (including gNB-ID handling) commonly propagate into transport binding and CUUP mapping tables in OAI; the logs also show dual/conflicting GTPU init states.

Cross-reference: CU prints `Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584` while the misconfigured param demands `0xFFFFFFFF`. OAI encodes/derives NGAP IDs from config; out-of-range values often get masked (`id & ((1<<bitLength)-1)`), causing mismatches between internal subsystems (NGAP/F1/E1) if components or paths derive/validate differently.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU MAC shows a healthy UE: RA completed (`CBRA procedure succeeded`), BLER decreases, UL/DL rounds increment.
- F1AP/SCTP errors: `Connect failed: Connection refused` with `Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...` looping.

Interpretation: DU initially connected (F1 Setup seen at CU), UE traffic flowed, then CU crashed during PDU session setup. After CU exit, DU’s F1 SCTP reconnect attempts are refused. No PHY/MAC misconfig indicated.

Link to gNB_ID: DU’s F1 Setup used `gNB_DU 3584`, aligning with CU’s runtime id. If DU was also fed `0xFFFFFFFF`, OAI likely masked it to 3584 for 22-bit macro; any divergence in masking/bit length selection between CU and DU could cause subtle identity mismatches over F1/NGAP, but here the visible id matches 3584.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE completes SecurityModeComplete, sends UECapabilityInformation, gets Registration Accept, sends RegistrationComplete and PDU Session Establishment Request.
- UE MAC stats keep updating; no immediate radio issues.

Interpretation: UE attach succeeded; failure occurs at data-plane establishment on the core side (CU-CP to CU-UP/NG-U binding), not UE radio or NAS.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU up → NGAP up → F1 up → UE RRC/NAS succeed → CU attempts E1/NG-U setup → GTP-U/E1 errors → assertion → CU exits → DU retries F1 (refused) while UE MAC still running locally.
- The misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is inconsistent with NGAP’s encoded macro id (3584). OAI typically requires `gNB_ID` to fit the configured bit length (commonly 22 for macro). Using `0xFFFFFFFF`:
  - Overflows 22-bit range; different subsystems may mask to different bit lengths (e.g., 22 vs 28 vs 32), causing divergent binary encodings (e.g., `0000e000` vs `ffffffff`).
  - Identity keys/indexing that map CU-CP contexts to CU-UP outputs can fail to bind (hence `try to get a gtp-u not existing output`).
  - Early `GTPU getaddrinfo ...` and `Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener` suggest transport setup confusion likely triggered by invalid/unsupported identity config and possibly missing/invalid IP configs that became visible when the CUUP binding tried to start.

Therefore, the root cause is the invalid `gNB_ID` value (`0xFFFFFFFF`) that does not respect NGAP bit-length constraints, leading to inconsistent identity handling across NGAP/F1AP/E1AP in OAI and culminating in CUUP mapping failure and CU crash during PDU session setup.

Note: The CU log line `NGAP 3584 -> 0000e000` explicitly shows the 22-bit macro-id encoding used. A valid config must provide a `gNB_ID` value within that field width (e.g., 3584) and be consistent across CU and DU configs.

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
1) Fix `gNB_ID` to a valid value consistent with the NGAP bit length used by OAI (e.g., 22-bit macro). For example, set `gNB_ID: 3584` in both CU and DU configs.

2) Ensure CU-UP transport is valid once identity is corrected:
- Provide valid local IP for GTP-U N3 and ensure `getaddrinfo` succeeds.
- Verify `E1AP` CUUP listener parameters (IP/port) and that they are not blocked or misconfigured.

3) Retest: Expect no `e1_bearer_context_setup` assertion; PDU session should complete and UE should get user-plane connectivity.

Corrected config snippets (JSON within `network_config` structure):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      // Use a valid macro gNB-ID that fits the NGAP bit length (e.g., 22 bits)
      // Was: 0xFFFFFFFF (invalid/out of range for macro id)
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": 3584,
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom",
        "ngap": {
          // Ensure AMF address matches logs
          "amf_ip": "192.168.8.43"
        },
        "cuup": {
          // Ensure CU-UP N3 listener has a valid bind address
          // Example for rfsim local testing
          "n3_bind_ip": "127.0.0.5",
          "n3_bind_port": 2152
        },
        "gtpu": {
          // Avoid empty/invalid local address; align with cuup.n3_bind_ip
          "local_ip": "127.0.0.5",
          "local_port": 2152
        }
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // Keep UE as-is; UE attach already succeeded
      // Provide band/arfcn to match logs if needed
      "rf": {
        "band": 78,
        "dl_center_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "numerology": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational checks after fix:
- CU log should show consistent `Registered new gNB ... id 3584` without conflicting masks.
- No `getaddrinfo` or CUUP listener failures.
- No `try to get a gtp-u not existing output` nor assertion in `e1_bearer_context_setup`.
- DU F1AP should remain connected (no connection refused loops).
- UE should complete PDU session and pass traffic.

---

## 7. Limitations
- The input lacks an explicit `network_config` object; we infer from logs and the provided misconfigured parameter.
- Logs are truncated and omit full CUUP/E1 configuration lines; IP/port examples are provided as likely fixes based on symptoms.
- Spec grounding: NGAP `gNB-ID` uses a configurable bit length (commonly 22 bits for macro); values must be within that width. An all-ones 32-bit value is invalid for a 22-bit macro configuration and leads to masking/inconsistencies in OAI.
