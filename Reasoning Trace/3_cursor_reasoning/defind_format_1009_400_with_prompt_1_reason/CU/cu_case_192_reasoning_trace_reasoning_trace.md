## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The deployment is OAI NR SA using rfsim: CU and DU are launched with `--rfsim --sa`, and the UE is an rfsimulator client repeatedly attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected bring-up: process start → config validation → CU starts NGAP/F1-C → DU starts F1-C to CU → DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim server → UE sync/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- The provided misconfiguration is **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**. In 5G NR, the gNB Identifier embedded in the NR Cell ID has a bounded bit-length (commonly up to 22 bits for the gNB ID part). A value like `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds typical allowed ranges and is expected to fail OAI’s configuration checks.
- Network behavior implied by logs:
  - CU exits during configuration checks (before F1/NGAP activation).
  - DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (`Connection refused`) and waits for F1 Setup Response, so it never activates radio.
  - UE repeatedly attempts to connect to the rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` because the DU never starts an active rfsim server (blocked waiting for CU/F1).

Network config summary (from the conceptual `network_config` JSON):
- `gnb_conf` (key items relevant to logs):
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID = 0xFFFFFFFF` (misconfigured; out of allowed range)
  - `plmn_list` appears invalid in CU logs: `mcc: -1 invalid value` (a secondary issue)
  - F1-C addresses: DU targets CU `127.0.0.5` from DU `127.0.0.3` per logs
  - TDD, band 78/48-like frequency around 3.6192 GHz; consistent across DU/UE
- `ue_conf` (key items):
  - rfsimulator client with `rfsimulator_serveraddr` likely `127.0.0.1:4043`
  - DL frequency ~3.6192 GHz; numerology 1; N_RB 106; aligns with DU

Initial mismatch: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid; CU aborts at config check, preventing the rest of the flow. The `plmn_list` error (`mcc: -1`) is also invalid but secondary to the gNB ID causing early termination.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Mode and version:
  - `[UTIL] running in SA mode`, develop build.
- Early RAN init:
  - `RC.nb_nr_inst = 1, ...` and CU-specific identity `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU` printed.
- Config checks fail:
  - `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: mcc: -1 invalid value` and `[ENB_APP] ... plmn_list ... wrong value`.
  - The process exits: `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- Consequence: CU never brings up SCTP listener for F1-C nor NGAP towards AMF. This guarantees DU F1-C connection attempts will be refused.
- Cross-reference with `gnb_conf`: An invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` typically triggers OAI’s `config_execcheck` path; the MCC=-1 confirms at least one additional invalid field in `plmn_list`. Both are configuration-layer failures (no radio/NGAP bring-up yet).

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC and prints TDD schedule, SSB/PointA/band, antenna ports, etc. No PHY crash/assert is shown.
- F1-C connection attempts:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` then repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused`.
  - DU logs: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` loop.
- Interpretation: DU is healthy enough to attempt F1-C, but the CU is not listening (it exited). Without F1 Setup Response, DU does not activate radio nor the rfsim server endpoint that UE needs.
- Link to `gnb_conf`:
  - The DU’s F1 target CU IP is 127.0.0.5 (consistent with a typical lab setup). The failure is endpoint refusal, not network reachability.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE PHY initializes with parameters matching DU (mu=1, N_RB=106, DL=3619200000 Hz).
- UE runs rfsimulator as client:
  - `Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side` and repeated `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)`.
- Interpretation: The rfsim server socket is not open because DU never activated radio (blocked on F1 setup). Thus, UE can never attach.
- Link to `ue_conf`:
  - `rfsimulator_serveraddr` is consistent with logs. Radio frequency settings are aligned; the blocker is server availability.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU exits at config check due to invalid parameters → DU’s SCTP to CU is refused → DU remains in pre-activation state → rfsim server not listening → UE connection attempts fail (errno 111).
- Root cause tied to misconfigured parameter:
  - The provided misconfigured parameter is `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In 5G NR/OAI, the gNB ID must fit within the gNB Identifier bit-length used to compose the 36-bit NR Cell ID (gNB ID bits + 14-bit or 8-bit cell ID portion, depending on configuration). `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits all ones) is beyond common allowed ranges for the gNB ID portion and is rejected by OAI’s config validation.
  - The CU’s `config_execcheck` failure is consistent with out-of-range identity values; the concurrent `mcc: -1` strengthens the conclusion that the configuration contains invalid fields. However, even with MCC fixed, the out-of-range `gNB_ID` alone would be sufficient to abort CU.
- Therefore, the single controlling fault that explains all three components’ symptoms is the invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID`, which prevents CU startup and cascades to DU/UE failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Immediate corrective actions:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within OAI’s allowed range (commonly within 22 bits). Example values: `0x0000001A` (26 decimal) or `0x00000C01`.
- Fix the `plmn_list` to valid MCC/MNC digits (e.g., MCC `001`, MNC `01` or your intended PLMN).
- Ensure CU and DU have consistent PLMN and that F1-C IPs/ports remain correct.

      },
      "plmn": { "mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2 } // align with gNB
    }
  }
}
```

Operational validation steps:
- After applying the changes, start CU first and confirm it passes config check and opens F1-C/NGAP sockets.
- Start DU and verify F1 Setup completes (no `Connection refused`). DU should log radio activation.
- Start UE and verify it connects to rfsim server and proceeds to SSB sync, RACH, and RRC attach.
- If additional issues persist (e.g., PRACH or TDD symbol mapping), verify `tdd_ul_dl_configuration_common`, SSB position, and any PRACH-related parameters. None were indicated as problematic in current logs.

Further analysis (if needed):
- Inspect OAI config schema/validation for `gNB_ID` and PLMN using project docs/source to confirm exact numeric bounds in your branch/tag.
- Ensure `gNB_CU_id`/`gNB_DU_id` printed in logs (e.g., `3584`) are independent internal IDs and not the same field as `gNBs.gNB_ID`.

## 7. Limitations

- The exact `network_config` JSON was not fully provided; snippets above assume typical OAI fields inferred from logs.
- CU logs also show an invalid PLMN MCC (`-1`), which is another misconfiguration. The analysis prioritizes the provided misconfigured parameter (`gNBs.gNB_ID`) as the main root cause because it alone can abort CU bring-up and matches the cascading symptoms.
- Log timestamps are omitted; ordering is inferred from message content.
