## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The system is running OAI 5G NR in SA mode with RFsimulator. CU logs show NGAP and GTP-U setup toward AMF and CU-UP; DU attempts F1-C SCTP toward the CU; UE repeatedly tries to connect to the RFsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 and fails because the DU never activates radio without F1 setup. The provided misconfigured parameter is `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.

From typical OAI configs and 3GPP constraints:
- The NR gNB ID used in NGAP (macro gNB ID) is limited in size (commonly up to 22 bits, per 3GPP TS 38.413 and the composition of 36-bit NR Cell Identity where gNB ID occupies 22 bits and the remaining bits identify the cell). A value of `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all-ones) exceeds valid ranges and must be masked/truncated. Inconsistent masking between CU and DU can yield divergent internal IDs.
- Network config (based on logs):
  - CU: NGAP shows macro gNB id 3584 and logs `3584 -> 0000e000`, indicating bit-shifting/masking of the configured ID. AMF connectivity succeeds.
  - DU: announces `gNB_DU_id 3584` and tries to connect F1-C to CU at 127.0.0.5, but SCTP is refused repeatedly. DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
  - UE: same DL/UL frequency as gNB (3619200000 Hz, N_RB 106, μ=1), but cannot connect to the rfsim server because DU is not up.

Initial mismatch: The configured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid. CU appears to mask it to 3584 (0xE00) for NGAP, while DU also displays 3584. Despite that, CU-side F1-C server does not accept the DU’s connection, suggesting upstream rejection or non-listening state possibly caused by invalid/ambiguous gNB identity handling during CU initialization (e.g., ID length/bit allocation inconsistencies preventing F1 from coming up), even though NGAP proceeds with AMF.

Expected flow: CU starts, NGAP connects to AMF, F1-C server listens; DU starts, connects F1-C, performs F1 Setup, then activates radio; UE connects to rfsim server and proceeds with cell search, SIB1, RA/PRACH, RRC, etc. Here, flow stops at DU↔CU F1-C SCTP.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode: SA; NGAP/GTPT-U initialized; CU-UP accepted with ID 3584; `Send NGSetupRequest` → `Received NGSetupResponse` (AMF OK).
- Key line: `Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584` and `3584 -> 0000e000` (bit manipulation consistent with constrained macro gNB ID field).
- Notably absent: explicit CU F1AP server start/listen logs. If CU-CP did not bring up F1-C listener due to invalid gNB identity configuration resolution, DU’s F1-C connection would be refused.
- Cross-reference: The CU has sufficient configuration to talk to AMF (IP 192.168.8.43), but F1-C readiness isn’t evidenced. Invalid `gNB_ID` could lead to internal errors that skip or fail F1-C setup while not crashing NGAP.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 with TDD pattern, frequencies (3619.2 MHz), μ=1, N_RB=106. ServingCellConfigCommon parsed; everything looks sane.
- F1AP: `Starting F1AP at DU` then attempts SCTP to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` → DU retries and logs `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- DU reports `gNB_DU_id 3584` which matches the CU’s macro gNB id rendering. Despite that, connection is refused at TCP/SCTP layer, usually meaning no listener on the CU target IP:port, or immediate policy rejection.
- Given the misconfigured `gNB_ID`, the CU may not have entered a valid F1-C serving state or might have failed to bind the SCTP server due to ID-related internal consistency checks or derived identifiers used in F1 setup context.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config aligns with gNB PHY (3619.2 MHz, N_RB 106). It attempts RFsim connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly and fails (errno 111: connection refused). This is expected because the DU does not activate radio until F1 Setup completes.
- No PRACH/RRC activity: the problem is upstream at DU↔CU F1-C.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU reaches NGAP ready; DU starts and tries F1-C to CU; SCTP refused repeatedly; UE cannot connect to rfsim server. So the first blocker is CU not accepting DU’s F1-C association.
- The misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is out of spec for the NR macro gNB ID field length. OAI code typically applies bit masks and/or requires a configured `gNB_id_bits`/cell identity composition. An out-of-range value can cause:
  - Non-deterministic truncation/masking between CU and DU, leading to inconsistent derived IDs.
  - Internal assertion or path that prevents F1AP server initialization at the CU while still allowing NGAP to proceed (since NGAP used a masked 3584 which AMF accepted).
  - Mismatches in the gNB ID or PLMN/cell identity presented at F1 Setup that cause immediate CU-side refusal (manifesting as a connection refused if no listener is up, or as association failures if listener rejects after accept). Here the observed state is consistent with no listener or immediate refusal before association, indicating CU F1-C never started.
- Therefore, the root cause is the invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. Correct range must respect the configured gNB ID bit length (commonly ≤ 22 bits for macro gNB ID). A safe fix is to choose a valid, unique value consistent across CU and DU (e.g., `0xE00` or decimal `3584`) and align any `gNB_id_bits` setting if present.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within the allowed bit-length and ensure the same value is used by both CU and DU. Example: `0xE00` (decimal 3584) to match what NGAP showed, or any other value < 2^22.
- If config has `gNB_id_bits`, set appropriately (e.g., 22) and ensure DU and CU use the same.
- Validate CU F1AP server comes up after the change (look for explicit F1AP listen/bind logs on the CU side). The DU should then establish SCTP, receive F1 Setup Response, and activate radio; the UE should then connect to the rfsim server and proceed to PRACH/RRC.
- Sanity checks:
  - Confirm CU’s F1-C bind IP matches DU’s `F1-C CU` IP (here 127.0.0.5). Adjust if needed.
  - Confirm no port conflicts/firewall on loopback.
  - After fixing, check for RRC/PRACH activity and successful attach.

```

Operational steps:
- Update CU and DU configs with the valid `gNB_ID` and aligned `gNB_id_bits`.
- Restart CU first; confirm F1AP server ready (look for F1 listen/bind logs).
- Start DU; confirm SCTP connects and F1 Setup completes; radio activates.
- Start UE; verify RFsim connects and RRC establishment proceeds.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not include explicit CU F1AP server start messages nor the exact `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` bodies. The diagnosis relies on the misconfigured parameter hint and observed behavior (SCTP refused and NGAP success) consistent with invalid gNB ID handling preventing CU F1-C readiness.
- Exact bit-length for `gNB_ID` depends on configuration (e.g., `gNB_id_bits`) and implementation specifics in OAI. The recommended value (0xE00) is chosen to match observed NGAP output; any unique value within the allowed range will work if applied consistently.
