## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The logs show OAI NR SA mode with RF simulator: CU/DU/UE all print "running in SA mode" and UE tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (RFsim port). Expected flow in SA+rfsim: CU starts (NGAP, F1-C server), DU starts (F1-C client, activates radio after F1 Setup), then UE connects to rfsim, performs SSB sync → PRACH → RRC → NGAP → PDU session.
- Provided misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In 5G NR, the gNB ID used in NGAP and for composing NR Cell Identity has bounded length (commonly 22 bits for gNB-ID in NG RAN; NR cell identity is 36 bits = gNB-ID (22) + gNB-DU cell ID (14)). Value `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all ones = 4,294,967,295) exceeds valid ranges for the typical 22-bit gNB-ID and is also a sentinel/all-ones value likely rejected by OAI validation.
- Network config summary (inferred from logs and typical OAI configs):
  - gnb_conf: SA, TDD in band n78 around 3619.2 MHz, `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280`, `N_RB=106`, `tdd_ul_dl_configuration_common` consistent with 5 ms period, `gNB_CU_id`/`gNB_DU_id` observed as 3584 in F1AP prints, and `gNBs.gNB_ID` set to `0xFFFFFFFF` (misconfigured).
  - ue_conf: SA, same frequency and numerology, rfsim client to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Initial mismatch: The DU repeatedly fails SCTP connect to CU (`Connection refused`), while UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server (`errno(111)`). CU log stops after config reading and before starting F1/NGAP. This aligns with CU aborting initialization due to invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID`.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU confirms SA mode and shows build info, then RAN context initialized with no MAC/L1 (as expected for CU). It prints `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- Warning: `unknown integrity algorithm "0"` in security section — typically a non-fatal config warning in OAI (falls back to defaults) and not the proximate cause here.
- CU reads multiple config sections then stops; there is no evidence of starting SCTP server for F1-C or NGAP connection to AMF. Absence of subsequent CU activity while DU attempts SCTP connects implies CU did not complete startup and likely exited during config validation.
- Cross-ref to `gNBs.gNB_ID`: OAI validates gNB-ID length/value for NGAP and for composing NR cell identity; an out-of-range or sentinel value typically triggers an assert or error leading to early termination, preventing the CU from opening F1-C SCTP.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC successfully: band/numerology match UE, TDD configuration computed, SIB1 parameters printed, and `F1AP: Starting F1AP at DU` proceeds.
- DU attempts SCTP connect to CU on `127.0.0.5` from `127.0.0.3` and receives `Connection refused`. It retries repeatedly.
- DU prints `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`, which is why the rfsim server side is not yet active for UE to connect. No PHY/MAC assertion or PRACH errors are present; the DU is healthy but blocked on F1 setup.
- This behavior is consistent with CU not listening on F1-C due to failure during initialization.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes with DL/UL freq 3619200000 Hz, `N_RB_DL=106`, TDD, matching DU. Threads start, and UE acts as rfsim client.
- It continuously tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails with `errno(111)` (connection refused). In OAI, the DU enables the rfsim server only after receiving F1 Setup Response from CU. Since DU never completes F1 setup, the rfsim server is not accepting connections, causing UE failures.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU: stops post-config due to invalid parameter; does not start F1/NGAP.
  - DU: retries F1-C SCTP to CU, receives `Connection refused` because CU is not listening.
  - UE: retries rfsim connection, receives `Connection refused` because DU has not activated radio without F1 setup.
- Root cause guided by misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid (exceeds 22-bit gNB-ID domain and is an all-ones sentinel). OAI likely rejects this during NGAP/RRC identity setup, aborting CU startup. This single misconfiguration cascades to F1 failure and UE rfsim connection failures.
- Spec/implementation rationale:
  - 3GPP NGAP (TS 38.413) uses a constrained gNB-ID (commonly 22 bits). NR cell identity (TS 38.331/38.211 context) uses 36 bits, expecting a valid gNB-ID portion.
  - OAI config expects `gNBs.gNB_ID` to fit within configured gNB-ID length and not use reserved/all-ones values; invalid values typically trigger asserts or error returns in config parsing.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Fix: Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, bounded value consistent with the configured gNB-ID length. Safe choice: a small value such as `0x00000001` (or any value ≤ 0x3FFFFF if gNB-ID length is 22 bits). Ensure CU and DU share coherent identities for NR cell identity composition; keep `gNB_CU_id`/`gNB_DU_id` as currently printed (3584) unless you have specific reasons to change them.
- After change, expected behavior: CU completes init and opens F1-C; DU connects and receives F1 Setup Response; DU activates radio and opens rfsim server; UE connects to `127.0.0.1:4043`, decodes SSB/SIB1, and proceeds with RA/RRC.
- Additional checks:
  - Validate NGAP/AMF config (AMF IP/PLMN/TAC) though unrelated to this failure mode.
  - Keep security algorithms to supported values to avoid noise in logs.

      ],

```

Operational steps:
- Update CU `gnb.conf` to set `gNBs.gNB_ID` as above; make the same change wherever `gnb.conf` is templated/generated.
- Start CU → confirm it opens F1-C and NGAP; start DU → observe F1 Setup success; start UE → confirm rfsim connection success.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not show explicit CU fatal error messages; the diagnosis relies on the misconfigured parameter and the observed absence of CU F1/NGAP startup coupled with DU/UE connection refusals.
- Exact allowed gNB-ID length may vary with configuration; the safe constraint is to avoid out-of-range/all-ones values and remain within typical 22-bit limits used by OAI for NGAP gNB-ID.
