## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
This is OAI 5G NR SA with `--rfsim` for CU/DU/UE. Expected sequence: CU and DU load configs → CU passes config checks and starts F1-C listener → DU establishes SCTP to CU and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio and rfsim server → UE connects to rfsim, detects SSB/does PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session. Typical failure classes: invalid config caught by CU validator, F1 setup mismatches, and UE rfsim connection refused when DU is not active.

Guiding misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In OAI, `gNB_ID` is a bit string constrained by `gNB_id_bits` (often 22). A 32‑bit all‑ones value exceeds the allowed range and is rejected by the config validator (`config_execcheck`).

From the provided logs:
- CU: after startup prints, the validator reports `tracking_area_code: -1 invalid` and then `[CONFIG] ... gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` before calling `exit_fun`. This indicates at least one fatal misconfiguration; per task guidance the root cause to focus on is `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (out of range for configured bit-length). The invalid TAC is a secondary issue that also needs fixing but is not the guided root cause.
- DU: fully initializes PHY/MAC, then repeatedly fails SCTP to CU with `Connection refused` and waits for F1 Setup Response before activating the radio.
- UE: repeatedly gets `ECONNREFUSED` when trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (rfsim server), consistent with DU not activating rfsim because F1 Setup never succeeded.

Immediate cross-check with effective network config:
- The CU never gets past config validation; therefore, F1 listener is absent and DU’s SCTP connect attempts are refused. UE cannot connect to rfsim because DU defers activation until after F1 Setup success.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode: SA, rfsim implied by command line. Binary/version info printed.
- Validator output:
  - `config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: -1 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533` → non-guided but real issue to fix.
  - `[ENB_APP][CONFIG] ... gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` → fatal; immediately followed by `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`.
- Interpretation: CU exits during configuration checks; no F1AP/NGAP stack is brought up. Given the guided misconfigured parameter, `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` violates `gNB_id_bits` constraints and is rejected.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- PHY/MAC init is healthy: frequency 3619200000 Hz (NR band 48/78 notation shown), μ=1, N_RB=106, TDD configured, antenna counts set, ServingCellConfigCommon parsed.
- DU prepares F1AP toward CU (`127.0.0.5`) but logs repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and remains in a retry loop; prints “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio”.
- Interpretation: Since CU exited early, the F1 listener is not available; connect attempts are refused. DU intentionally holds radio/rfsim activation until F1 Setup completes.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE RF params align with DU (3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106, TDD).
- UE repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and receives `errno(111)` → rfsim server not listening.
- Interpretation: DU did not activate rfsim due to missing F1 Setup success, so UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  1) CU exits on config validation failure.
  2) DU cannot establish SCTP to CU → no F1 Setup → DU keeps radio/rfsim inactive.
  3) UE rfsim connection refused because no server is listening.
- Root cause guided by misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is out-of-range for the configured `gNB_id_bits` and is rejected by OAI’s `config_execcheck`, causing CU to terminate. The invalid TAC (`-1`) is a separate, also-fatal misconfiguration to fix, but even with TAC corrected, `gNB_ID` must be within range and consistent across CU/DU to avoid identity issues later.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Mandatory config fixes (CU and DU, keep values consistent across both):
- Set `gNB_id_bits` explicitly (e.g., 22) and choose a `gNB_ID` that fits within that bit-length (e.g., 3584). Avoid 32-bit all-ones.
- Fix `tracking_area_code` to an allowed value (e.g., 1..65533). Example: 1.

Illustrative corrected snippets within a `network_config` JSON framing:
```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_id_bits": 22,            // make bit-length explicit and uniform
        "gNB_ID": 3584,               // valid 22-bit value (example)
        "tracking_area_code": 1       // fix from -1 to a valid TAC
        // ... other existing parameters unchanged ...
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No gNB_ID-related changes required. Ensure rfsimulator_serveraddr is 127.0.0.1 if DU is local.
    }
  }
}
```

Post-fix validation steps:
- CU boots without `exit_fun`; no `[CONFIG] ... wrong value` lines.
- DU establishes SCTP to CU and completes F1 Setup; DU logs radio activation and rfsim server binding.
- UE connects to 127.0.0.1:4043 and proceeds to SSB/PRACH and RRC attach.
- If any residual failures occur, verify PLMN alignment (MCC/MNC/MNC length) and F1-C IP/port alignment (`127.0.0.5` on CU vs DU’s target), and raise logging levels for F1AP/NGAP.

## 7. Limitations
- Exact `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` JSON blocks are not included; fixes assume standard OAI field names/semantics inferred from logs.
- CU also reports an invalid TAC; although secondary in the guided analysis, it is fatal and must be corrected alongside `gNB_ID`.
- No external spec lookups required; behavior matches OAI’s config validator rejecting out-of-range `gNB_ID` and invalid TAC.
