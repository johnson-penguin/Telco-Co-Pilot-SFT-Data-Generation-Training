## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs indicate a Standalone (SA) OAI 5G NR setup using the RF simulator (rfsimulator) with split CU (CU-CP) and DU processes:
- CU successfully initializes NGAP and registers with AMF.
- DU initializes PHY/MAC, attempts F1-C association to the CU, but gets repeated SCTP connection refused.
- UE repeatedly attempts to connect to the rfsim server (127.0.0.1:4043) and fails, which typically happens when the DU side of rfsim is not up/accepting connections (because DU is blocked waiting for F1 activation).

Expected flow in SA+rfsim:
1) CU init → NGSetup with AMF → F1-C server up on CU side.
2) DU init → F1Setup towards CU → upon F1 established, DU activates radio and brings up rfsim server.
3) UE connects to rfsim server, synchronizes via SSB, performs RACH/PRACH → RRC → PDU session.

Provided misconfiguration: "gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF".
- In OAI/NGAP, the gNB ID is involved in GlobalGNB-ID and macro gNB ID derivation. OAI commonly operates with a 20-bit macro gNB ID mode; an out-of-range value (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFF) overflows and gets masked/truncated, leading to inconsistent IDs used across procedures.
- CU logs already show: "Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584" and "3584 -> 0000e000". 3584 decimal is 0xE00, implying OAI masked the configured value and derived 0xE000/0xE00-sized IDs. This is a red flag that the configured ID exceeded the supported bit-length and was implicitly truncated.

Network configuration (extracted gnb_conf/ue_conf):
- While the exact JSON content is not pasted, we infer key fields from logs:
  - gNB: SA mode, TDD band 78, DL freq 3619200000 Hz, N_RB 106, SSB numerology 1, F1-C CU IP 127.0.0.5, DU IP 127.0.0.3. gNB ID configured as 0xFFFFFFFF (misconfigured).
  - UE: DL/UL freq 3619200000 Hz, rfsimulator client to 127.0.0.1:4043. IMSI etc. not shown but not directly relevant to the present failure.

Early mismatch signals:
- The CU derives macro gNB id 3584 despite the config 0xFFFFFFFF.
- DU shows gNB_DU_id 3584 in F1AP banner, but F1 association is refused by CU (SCTP connect refused), suggesting CU’s F1 server likely didn’t start or was mis-initialized due to the invalid gNB ID handling.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key CU events:
- SA mode, threads for SCTP/NGAP/RRC created; NGAP configured with AMF IP 192.168.8.43.
- "Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584"; then NGSetupRequest is sent and NGSetupResponse received from AMF. GTP-U is configured on 192.168.8.43:2152.
- Accepts new CU-UP ID 3584; CU control-plane seems healthy with AMF.

Anomalies:
- No explicit log line confirming F1-C server listening. In typical OAI, F1 task starts on CU-CP; however, miscomputed/invalid gNB identity can prevent proper F1 configuration/bring-up. The DU’s repeated SCTP connection refused implies CU is not listening on the expected F1-C endpoint.
- The conversion log "3584 -> 0000e000" indicates bit-level packing of the gNB ID and supports the hypothesis of masking/truncation due to the oversized configured value.

Cross-reference:
- NGAP proceeds despite the ID anomaly (AMF generally accepts GlobalGNB-ID with a valid bit string). F1 may be stricter internally in OAI initialization if identity or derived IDs are inconsistent, leading to F1 server not binding.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
DU initialization is comprehensive and error-free at PHY/MAC:
- PHY/MAC configured for TDD (period index 6), DL freq 3619200000 Hz, N_RB 106, SSB absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 (3619.2 MHz), antenna numbers, timers, etc.
- F1AP starts: "F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 127.0.0.3".
- Immediately after: repeated "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" followed by F1AP retry messages.
- DU then waits: "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio". This prevents the rfsim server from serving UE connections.

Link to configuration:
- DU displays gNB_DU_id 3584 in its banner, which matches the CU’s derived macro id (3584). That indicates DU’s local view of the ID is 3584, but the CU might not have a consistent or acceptable internal identity due to the initial 0xFFFFFFFF setting on the CU side.
- The failure mode (SCTP refused) points to the CU not listening rather than address mismatch; the IPs appear correct (127.0.0.5 from DU to CU).


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
UE shows correct RF parameters for band 78, numerology 1, N_RB 106; it tries to connect to the rfsimulator at 127.0.0.1:4043 as a client.
- Repeated connect() errno(111) means connection refused because server isn’t up.
- In OAI rfsim, the DU side typically acts as the server; since DU is blocked awaiting F1 Setup Response, it has not activated the radio/time source and rfsim server side, so UE cannot connect.

Thus UE failures are secondary effects of DU not completing F1 with CU.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU completes NGSetup with AMF but apparently doesn’t bring up F1-C listening socket.
- DU repeatedly attempts SCTP to CU’s F1-C; all refuse.
- UE cannot connect to rfsim server because DU holds activation until F1 is established.

Misconfigured parameter: gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF.
- In NGAP, GlobalGNB-ID permits 22..32-bit gNB IDs as a BIT STRING. However, OAI’s internal macro gNB ID logic often assumes a 20-bit macro ID mode for derivations and masks the configured ID to a smaller size (hence 3584/0xE00 seen). Setting 0xFFFFFFFF exceeds the supported range/mode and leads to truncation.
- This truncation can produce inconsistent identity artifacts across subsystems (NGAP vs F1 vs internal CU/DU IDs). The CU log line converting 3584 to 0000e000 evidences bit-packing/masking behavior post-truncation.
- Likely consequence: CU’s F1 initialization logic fails to register a valid local gNB identity or otherwise refuses to bind/listen due to inconsistent or invalid configuration derived from the oversized gNB_ID. As a result, DU’s F1 SCTP attempts are refused.

Root cause: Using an out-of-range gNB ID value (0xFFFFFFFF) that violates OAI’s expected macro gNB ID width, causing ID truncation and preventing proper F1 server bring-up on the CU.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Configure `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a value within the supported macro gNB ID range and ensure consistency across CU and DU. In macro-20-bit mode, keep it < 2^20 (1,048,576). Example: 3584 (0xE00), which matches what the logs show as the derived macro id. Any small unique value is fine (e.g., 0x12345), as long as both CU and DU use the same.

Also verify F1 addressing:
- Ensure CU is configured to listen on `127.0.0.5` for F1-C and DU points to that address. Confirm the F1-C port (default SCTP 38472) is consistent. After fixing gNB_ID, the CU should start F1 and DU should connect.

      "rfsimulator": {
        // UE is client to local rfsim server; DU must be up to accept this
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Apply the `gNB_ID` change on both CU and DU configs; restart CU first, confirm F1-C server is listening (SCTP), then start DU and observe F1 Setup succeeds, DU activates radio.
- UE should then be able to connect to rfsim server (no more errno 111), proceed to SSB sync, PRACH, RRC, etc.

Further validation:
- If issues persist, increase CU/DU log levels for F1AP and NGAP; confirm with `ss -anp | grep 38472` on CU host that SCTP is listening post-fix.
- Optionally pick a different safe `gNB_ID` (e.g., `0x12345`) to rule out collisions; keep consistent across CU/DU.


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and don’t show explicit F1 server start on CU nor detailed error traces that tie the invalid gNB_ID to F1 binding failure; the diagnosis leverages OAI behavior where oversized gNB IDs are masked, creating inconsistent identities. The CU log "3584 -> 0000e000" strongly suggests truncation from an invalid larger value.
- Exact `gnb_conf` and `ue_conf` JSON content wasn’t included; the snippets are representative fixes consistent with the observed parameters.
- Standards context: NGAP allows 22..32-bit gNB IDs, but implementation constraints (macro-ID handling) in OAI require practical limits; hence the recommendation to use a 20-bit-safe value for compatibility with OAI’s macro-ID mode.
