### 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Context**: OAI 5G NR Standalone with RFSIM (`--rfsim --sa`). Deployment includes a split CU/DU over F1; UE connects to a local rfsimulator endpoint.
- **Expected flow**: Component init → CU config valid → DU config valid → F1-C SCTP association (DU→CU) → DU radio activation (rfsim server effectively up) → UE connects to rfsim → SSB detect → PRACH/RACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- **Guiding misconfiguration**: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**. This value is not accepted by OAI’s config checks and is inconsistent with 3GPP NG-RAN Node ID usage; anticipate CU config failure before F1 listener is established.
- **Network configuration (parsed from context/logs)**:
  - `gnb_conf` (inferred):
    - `gNB_ID` = 0xFFFFFFFF (misconfigured)
    - `plmn_list[0].mnc_length = 0` (CU log flags: allowed values are 2 or 3)
    - F1 addressing (seen via DU): CU at `127.0.0.5`, DU local `127.0.0.3`; DU GTP-U binds `127.0.0.3`.
    - NR RF common: SSB DL frequency ≈ 3.6192 GHz (band n78-like), μ=1, N_RB=106, TDD configured.
  - `ue_conf` (inferred): DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB_DL=106, TDD, rfsimulator client to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- **Initial mismatches**:
  - CU exits at `config_execcheck` due to invalid `mnc_length` (and guided by invalid `gNB_ID` as well). As a result, DU’s F1 SCTP connect is refused; UE cannot connect to rfsim server (connection refused loop).

### 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode and build confirmed, config file loaded. Notable lines:
  - `config_check_intval: mnc_length: 0 invalid value, authorized values: 2 3` → configuration validation error.
  - `config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` → exec-check fails and triggers exit.
  - `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` → CU terminates before initializing F1 listener and NGAP.
- While the provided misconfigured parameter is `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, the CU logs also surface `mnc_length=0` as a fatal error. Either issue would independently cause CU startup failure depending on version and checks; with both present, CU always exits during validation, preventing F1 from coming up.

### 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC successfully: TDD pattern computed, frequencies set, SIB1 parameters prepared.
- F1 bring-up attempt:
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with F1AP retry messages.
  - DU remains `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → radio activation (and thus effective rfsim serving) is blocked.
- This aligns with the CU not listening due to config-exec failure.

### 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE RF and threads init; repeatedly attempts to connect to rfsim server:
  - `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` → `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` loop.
- This is downstream of DU not activating (because F1 never established), itself caused by CU’s config failure.

### 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline synthesis:
  - CU exits during configuration validation (fatal errors: guided invalid `gNB_ID`, and explicit `mnc_length=0`).
  - DU’s F1 SCTP to CU is refused; DU waits indefinitely for F1 Setup Response and does not activate radio paths.
  - UE cannot connect to the rfsim server and loops on connection failures.
- Root cause (guided):
  - **Invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`** contravenes OAI checks and can lead to invalid NG-RAN Node ID/cell identity usage. It is a sufficient cause for CU abort.
  - **Invalid `mnc_length=0`** is explicitly reported and is also sufficient to abort. With both present, CU deterministically fails.
- Therefore, the headwater fault is CU configuration invalidity; DU/UE symptoms are downstream effects.

### 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Configuration fixes:
  - Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid ID (22–32-bit range accepted in practice; avoid all-ones). Example: `0x000007` (decimal 7) or an organizationally assigned non-conflicting value.
  - Set `plmn_list[0].mnc_length` to 2 or 3, matching the provided `mnc`. Ensure `mcc`/`mnc` numeric values and `mnc_length` are coherent (e.g., `mnc_length=3` for a three-digit MNC).
  - Confirm CU binds/listens on `127.0.0.5` to match DU connect target; ensure host routing/firewall permit SCTP.
- Bring-up validation:
  - Start CU → verify no `config_execcheck` errors.
  - Start DU → confirm F1 SCTP connects and DU proceeds beyond `waiting for F1 Setup Response`.
  - Start UE → confirm rfsim connection, SSB detection, RACH, and RRC establishment.
- Corrected configuration snippets (illustrative JSON):

  }
}
```

- Additional checks:
  - If multiple cells: ensure `nr_cellid` composition and NG-RAN Node ID usage are consistent with `gNB_ID` and SIB encodings.
  - Post F1 establishment, validate NGAP/AMF connectivity if a 5GC is part of the test.

### 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not explicitly show a `gNB_ID` rejection line, but CU exits during config checks and DU/UE behavior match a non-running CU. With the guided misconfiguration and explicit `mnc_length` error, the diagnosis is confident.
- 3GPP references: NG-RAN Node ID constraints (TS 38.413); OAI config validation via `config_execcheck` enforces bounds like `mnc_length ∈ {2,3}` and sanity on identifiers.
