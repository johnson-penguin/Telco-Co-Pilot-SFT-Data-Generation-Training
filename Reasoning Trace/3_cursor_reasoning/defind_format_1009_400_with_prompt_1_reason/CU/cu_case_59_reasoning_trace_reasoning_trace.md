## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The logs indicate SA mode with OAI `nr-softmodem` using `--rfsim` for CU, DU, and UE. Expected flow: components initialize → F1-C association between DU↔CU (SCTP) → CU connects to AMF (NGAP) → DU activates radio → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB detection/PRACH → RRC setup and PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In 5G NR, the gNB ID is encoded as part of `Global gNB ID` (TS 38.413/38.473) with bit-length 22..32 and is used throughout F1AP/NGAP identity. OAI also uses `gNBs.gNB_ID` from `gnb.conf` for node identity and interface setup. `0xFFFFFFFF` (all ones, 32-bit) is often out of valid configured bit-length and may be rejected or mishandled by identity encoding/ASN.1 generation, leading to control-plane startup failures.
- Network configuration JSON (gnb_conf/ue_conf) is not provided here; we therefore infer defaults from logs where possible:
  - CU: shows `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`, but no evidence of F1-C server accepting connections.
  - DU: `gNB_DU_id 3584`, `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3` connecting to `F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` (SCTP), repeatedly refused.
  - UE: RF simulator client attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, repeatedly refused, consistent with DU never enabling the RFsim server because DU is blocked waiting for F1 Setup.

Initial mismatch signals:
- DU retries SCTP to CU with `Connection refused` → CU not listening on F1-C, likely due to configuration initialization failure. This aligns with a malformed or invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` causing CU F1AP stack not to bind.
- UE cannot connect to RFsim port 4043 → DU never starts RFsim server because radio activation is deferred until after successful F1 Setup Response.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA mode; build info present; RAN context shows `RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` and `RC.nb_RU = 0` consistent with CU-only split.
- It reads multiple config sections (`GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, events). A warning appears for an unknown UE ciphering algorithm `nea9`, but this is not fatal for F1.
- Notably absent: CU logs do not show F1AP server startup (no "Starting F1AP at CU" or SCTP bind/listen lines). No NGAP/AMF connection lines either.
- Cross-ref: DU attempts to connect to `127.0.0.5` but gets `Connection refused`, which means CU’s SCTP server socket was not created/listening. A common cause is config validation failing before F1AP init. An invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` would impact Global gNB ID composition and can prevent F1AP/NGAP from initializing.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC fully (antennas, TDD configuration, frequencies, numerology, SIB1, timers) and then starts F1AP client.
- F1AP: attempts to connect from `127.0.0.3` to CU `127.0.0.5`, but SCTP connect repeatedly fails with `Connection refused`. DU remains in the state `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` and repeatedly retries.
- There are no PHY assertion/crash signs; it’s stalled at control-plane association. This implicates the CU side being down/uninitialized for F1.
- Config linkage: DU identity (`gNB_DU_id 3584`) is fine; the problem is the peer (CU) not listening.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes RF parameters matching DU: DL/UL 3619.2 MHz, N_RB 106, SCS µ=1, TDD. Threads and hardware set up successfully.
- UE repeatedly attempts RFsim connection to `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails with `errno(111)` (connection refused). This is expected if the DU’s RFsim server is not up, which in OAI typically waits until after F1 Setup and gNB activation.
- Thus, UE failures are a downstream effect of DU not completing F1 association with CU.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline:
  - CU parses config but never opens F1-C listening socket.
  - DU repeatedly tries SCTP to CU and is refused; it explicitly logs waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim server because DU never activates radio without F1 Setup.
- Given the injected misconfiguration `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`, the most plausible failure is in CU identity handling during F1/NGAP initialization. In 5G NR:
  - The gNB ID forms part of the Global gNB ID used in F1AP/NGAP. The bit-length must be configured and the value must fit. An all-ones 32-bit value is often used as an invalid/sentinel value and may exceed the configured bit-length (e.g., 22 bits) or be rejected by validation.
  - If identity encoding fails, OAI can skip starting F1/NGAP tasks or fail to bind the SCTP server, leading to the observed `Connection refused` from DU.
- Therefore, the root cause is an invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` in CU `gnb.conf` (and possibly DU if shared), preventing CU F1AP server initialization. DU and UE failures are cascading effects.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, bounded value matching the configured gNB ID bit-length (typically ≤ 22 bits unless explicitly set to 32 in config). Use a small unique value and ensure CU/DU configuration is consistent with OAI expectations.

Suggested corrected snippets (representative; adapt names/IPs to your setup):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "gNB_ID": 4096,  // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF → valid bounded ID (example: 0x1000)
          "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
          "amf_ip_address": [
            { "ipv4": "127.0.0.18", "active": true, "preference": "ipv4" }
          ],
          "F1AP": {
            "CU_f1c_listen_ip": "127.0.0.5",  // ensure CU listens here
            "DU_f1c_target_ip": "127.0.0.3"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "serverport": 4043
      },
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "band": 78,
        "n_rb_dl": 106,
        "scs_khz": 30
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- If your deployment uses split CU/DU configs, ensure only the CU runs the F1-C server (listen/bind), and DU uses the CU IP as target. The `gNB_ID` must be valid and consistent with the bit-length in the config (if present) and should not be all-ones.
- After changing `gNB_ID`, verify CU logs contain F1AP server startup lines and that DU proceeds to `F1 Setup Response` and activates radio. UE should then connect to RFsim port 4043.

Further checks:
- Validate no other invalid fields (e.g., unknown `nea9` cipher in CU’s `security` section). Switch to a supported algorithm pair (e.g., `nea0`, `nea2`, `nea3`) if needed; however, this is not blocking F1.
- Confirm IPs and ports: CU listen `127.0.0.5` reachable from DU `127.0.0.3`; no firewall interference.
- If you explicitly configure gNB ID length, ensure value fits that length (e.g., for 22-bit, max is `(1<<22)-1 = 4194303`).

## 7. Limitations
- The input lacks a concrete `network_config` JSON; values above are inferred from logs and typical OAI defaults. Exact field names can vary across OAI versions; adjust accordingly.
- Logs are truncated and do not show CU F1AP bind errors explicitly; the diagnosis is based on the DU’s repeated `Connection refused` and the known invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` parameter.
- If issues persist after fixing `gNB_ID`, collect CU logs around F1AP initialization with increased verbosity to catch ASN.1 or identity encoding errors.
