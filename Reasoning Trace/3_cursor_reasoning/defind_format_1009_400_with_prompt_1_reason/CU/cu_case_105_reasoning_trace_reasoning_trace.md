## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- The system is running OAI 5G NR in SA mode with RFsimulator, as indicated by CU/DU/UE logs showing "--rfsim" and "--sa" and the UE attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (RFsim client toward gNB server).
- Expected end-to-end bring-up flow:
  - CU loads config, validates parameters, initializes NGAP/AMF and F1-C servers.
  - DU initializes PHY/MAC/RU, then establishes F1-C SCTP to CU and awaits F1 Setup Response, after which radio threads and RFsim server become active.
  - UE starts, syncs to SSB, and (in RFsim) connects to the gNB’s RFsim server; subsequently performs PRACH, RRC attach, and PDU session setup.
- Provided misconfiguration: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**. In 5G, the gNB ID is a bit string with length 22–32 bits per PLMN; OAI further constrains validity by `gNB_ID` together with `gNB_ID_length`. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (all ones, 32-bit) often violates the configured length/range or internal checks and is treated as invalid during config_exec checks.
- From logs:
  - CU aborts early with config checks (also flags `tracking_area_code: 0 invalid`), then exits.
  - DU fully initializes PHY/MAC and repeatedly retries F1-C SCTP to CU but gets `Connection refused`.
  - UE repeatedly fails to connect to RFsim server `127.0.0.1:4043`, errno(111), because the DU does not activate the RFsim server before F1 Setup completes.

About network_config:
- A `network_config` object was not provided in the JSON. We infer key effective parameters from logs:
  - DL/UL frequency ≈ 3.6192 GHz (Band 78/48 indication appears; DU prints band 48 with 0 offset due to config mapping; absoluteFrequencySSB 641280 -> 3619200000 Hz).
  - TDD pattern present (period index 6, slots 8DL/3UL per 10-slot period).
  - SSB numerology µ=1, `N_RB_DL=106`, `ofdm_symbol_size=2048`.
  - F1-C CU address expected at `127.0.0.5`, DU at `127.0.0.3` (from DU F1AP logs).
  - RFsim server should run on the DU/gNB side; UE tries `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial mismatch summary:
- Fatal misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (invalid per OAI config checks). Secondary issue also present in CU log: `tracking_area_code: 0` invalid (range 1..65533). The misconfigured gNB ID is sufficient to force CU exit, cascading failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU shows SA mode, version banner, and early RAN context init:
  - `RC.nb_nr_inst = 1, ... RC.nb_RU = 0, RC.nb_nr_CC[0] = 0` (CU-only instance; no RU/PHY at CU).
- Config validation errors:
  - `[CONFIG] config_check_intrange: tracking_area_code: 0 invalid value, authorized range: 1 65533`
  - `[ENB_APP] [CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value`
  - `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun`
- Interpretation:
  - CU parses `gNBs` section and fails its `config_execcheck`. While the log singles out `tracking_area_code` in a prior range check, the `section gNBs.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value` is consistent with at least one fatal parameter in the same section—here guided by the provided misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - Result: CU process exits before opening F1-C SCTP server on `127.0.0.5` and before NGAP/AMF connection is attempted.

Cross-reference with expected config:
- CU would normally declare the F1-C bind IP and listen; the DU logs show it tries connecting to CU `127.0.0.5`. The CU never gets that far because of the config validation failure.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes fully at PHY/MAC layer:
  - PHY parameters show TDD, µ=1, 106 PRBs, SSB at 3.6192 GHz; SIB1, MAC timers, HARQ counts, antenna ports, etc., are all configured.
  - F1AP at DU starts and tries SCTP connect: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Failure mode:
  - Repeated `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` with `[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...`.
  - `[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`—this prevents activation of the RFsim server and full radio pipeline.
- Interpretation:
  - Because CU has already exited, there is no F1-C listener at `127.0.0.5`, hence `ECONNREFUSED` at the DU. DU remains in a waiting loop.

Link to misconfiguration:
- The `gNB_ID` is defined in the CU’s `gNBs` section. An invalid `gNB_ID` is detected and forces CU exit, which directly causes DU’s F1-C failures.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE starts with matching RF parameters (µ=1, `N_RB_DL=106`, ~3.6192 GHz) and tries to connect to RFsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- It repeatedly fails: `connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)`.
- Interpretation:
  - In OAI RFsim, the gNB/DU side acts as the RFsim “server” and the UE as “client.” Because the DU blocks waiting for F1 Setup Response and does not activate radio/RFsim server until F1 is up, the UE cannot connect to RFsim. Thus the UE’s repeated `ECONNREFUSED` is a downstream symptom of CU’s early exit.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU exits during config validation due to invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (and also flags `tracking_area_code: 0`).
  - DU cannot establish F1-C with CU (`Connection refused`) and therefore does not activate radio nor start RFsim server.
  - UE cannot connect to RFsim server (`errno 111`), blocking any over-the-air procedures.

- Root cause:
  - Misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid given gNB ID length constraints. In 5G (TS 38.413 and TS 38.300 context), the gNB ID is a bit string with configurable length (commonly 22 bits in many OAI examples). Setting it to all ones `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit) without matching `gNB_ID_length` or within OAI’s accepted range triggers config checks to fail, causing the CU to exit.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Actionable fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value consistent with `gNB_ID_length`. If `gNB_ID_length` is 22, choose an ID within 22 bits (e.g., `0x000001` or a site-specific non-zero value below `0x400000`). If using a 32-bit length, ensure OAI is configured accordingly and that the value is acceptable. Avoid all-ones patterns.
- Also fix `tracking_area_code` to an in-range value (1..65533), e.g., `1` or your deployment’s TAC.
- Ensure CU F1-C bind/listen IP matches the DU’s target (`127.0.0.5`) and that CU is actually listening after config passes. Then DU should succeed in F1 Setup and activate the RFsim server; UE will subsequently connect.

Suggested corrected snippets in `network_config` shape (explanatory comments included):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "gNB_ID_length": 22, // keep default or your intended length
          "gNB_ID": 1,         // FIX: use a valid ID within gNB_ID_length (e.g., 1)
          "tracking_area_code": 1, // FIX: set within [1..65533]
          "F1AP": {
            "CU_bind_address": "127.0.0.5", // ensure CU binds here
            "DU_connect_address": "127.0.0.3"
          }
          // ... other existing parameters unchanged ...
        }
      ]
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", // UE will connect here
        "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043          // RFsim default for this setup
      }
      // Ensure UE frequencies/SSB numerology match DU (already consistent per logs)
    }
  }
}
```

If you prefer a 32-bit `gNB_ID`, explicitly align `gNB_ID_length` and avoid all-ones values which can be sentinel/invalid in some implementations:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": [
        {
          "gNB_ID_length": 32,
          "gNB_ID": 305419896, // example 0x12345678, not all-ones
          "tracking_area_code": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Validation/debug checklist:
- After edits, start CU and confirm no `[CONFIG] ... wrong value` messages.
- Confirm CU listens on F1-C (netstat/ss) and DU F1-C connects (no SCTP `Connection refused`).
- Observe DU logs move past “waiting for F1 Setup Response” and see RFsim server activation.
- UE should then successfully connect to RFsim server and proceed with SSB detection, PRACH, RRC, and PDU session setup.

## 7. Limitations

- The provided JSON lacks the `network_config` object; corrections above are shown as representative snippets inferred from logs and typical OAI defaults.
- CU log aggregates multiple config issues (also invalid `tracking_area_code`). The misconfigured `gNB_ID` alone is sufficient to cause the observed system-wide failure; fixing both is recommended.
- Log timestamps are omitted, so ordering is inferred from message sequences.
