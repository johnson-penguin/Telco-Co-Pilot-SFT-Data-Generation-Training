## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- **Mode and topology**: Logs indicate OAI NR SA mode with RF simulator (entries like "running in SA mode" and UE attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`). Expected bring-up: CU initializes → DU initializes → F1-C SCTP association (DU→CU) → F1 Setup → DU activates radio → UE connects to RFsim server → SSB/PRACH → RRC setup → data.
- **Key symptom**: DU endlessly retries F1 SCTP to CU (`Connection refused`), CU does not show F1AP startup, UE repeatedly fails to connect to RFsim server because DU keeps radio deactivated awaiting F1 Setup Response.
- **Guiding clue (misconfigured_param)**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - In NR, the `gNB-ID` is limited by spec to a bit length of 22 bits when used in the NR Cell Global ID (gNB-ID length ∈ {22..32}, commonly 22 bits in OAI deployments). `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) exceeds 22-bit range (max 4194303) and is typically invalid in OAI config, leading to encoding/validation failures in F1AP/NGAP/RRC contexts.
- **Network config summary (inferred)**:
  - `gnb_conf`: Contains `gNBs.gNB_ID`, F1AP CU/DU IPs, TDD config, band/numerology, etc. DU runtime prints show `gNB_DU_id 3584`, suggesting the DU side expects a sane ID (0xE00 / 3584). CU runtime does not show F1AP startup, consistent with invalid CU `gNB_ID` preventing CU F1AP init.
  - `ue_conf`: RFsim client to `127.0.0.1:4043`, DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, µ=1, N_RB=106; consistent with DU PHY prints.

Initial mismatch: DU uses/prints `gNB_DU_id 3584`, while `misconfigured_param` forces CU `gNB_ID` to `0xFFFFFFFF`. This asymmetry can break F1AP/NG setup at the CU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- CU shows init and config parsing:
  - `Initialized RAN Context ... RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` (CU-only role, no L1/MAC)
  - `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, `gNB_CU_name gNB-Eurecom-CU`
  - Warn: `unknown integrity algorithm "nia9"` (non-fatal; CU should still start)
  - Config reading lines repeat sections, but there is no subsequent line like `Starting F1AP at CU` nor SCTP `listening` prints. Absence of F1AP startup indicates CU did not initialize F1 properly.
- Cross-reference with config: An invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` at CU would cause F1AP node identities and cell identity derivations to be invalid, leading CU to fail/abort F1AP setup or not bind SCTP server. This matches DU's repeated `Connection refused` on 127.0.0.5.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC successfully, including numerology and band:
  - `DL frequency 3619200000 Hz ... band 48, µ=1, N_RB 106`
  - TDD pattern derived and applied; SIB1 values printed; no PRACH errors.
- F1AP client side:
  - `Starting F1AP at DU`
  - `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
  - Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and `retrying...`
  - `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` → DU blocks radio activation until CU responds; hence the RFsim server side is not fully available to UE.
- Identity printout: `gNB_DU_id 3584`, consistent with expected valid ID. If CU used `0xFFFFFFFF`, identities between CU and DU are inconsistent/invalid, preventing F1 association at CU side.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE PHY matches DU config (3619200000 Hz, µ=1, N_RB 106) and runs as RFsim client.
- UE repeatedly attempts TCP connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` and fails with `errno(111)` (connection refused). In OAI RFsim, the DU side typically provides the RFsim server endpoint. Since DU never activates radio (waiting on F1 Setup Response), the server is not accepting connections, so UE cannot proceed to SSB decode/PRACH.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline correlation:
  - CU parses config but never starts F1AP listening → DU SCTP connect refused → DU waits for F1 Setup Response and does not start radio → UE cannot connect to RFsim server and loops with connection refused.
- Guided by `misconfigured_param`:
  - `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds the valid OAI/3GPP range (commonly 22-bit). OAI uses `gNB_ID` in composing `NR Cell Global ID` and as F1AP/NGAP node identifiers. An out-of-range value likely triggers validation failure or results in invalid ASN.1 encodings that prevent CU from initializing F1.
  - DU prints a valid ID `3584` (0xE00). The mismatch/invalidation at CU is sufficient to explain CU not opening F1-C SCTP.
- Therefore, the **root cause** is an invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` configured on the CU side (set to `0xFFFFFFFF`), causing CU F1AP to fail initialization, cascading into DU F1 connection refusals and UE RFsim connection failures.

Note: Even though CU prints `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, the misconfigured parameter likely applies to another `gNBs` section or overrides used for NR cell identity; OAI may print one ID for CU app context while a different invalid `gNB_ID` in `gNBs` is consumed by F1/RRC encoders, leading to the observed behavior.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- **Fix the invalid gNB ID**: Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within allowed range and ensure CU and DU configurations are consistent. Typical safe values: decimal `3584` (hex `0xE00`) to match DU log, or any value in `[0 .. 4194303]` if using a 22-bit length. Avoid values with all bits set or reserved patterns.
- **Restart order**: After fixing CU config, start CU → DU; verify CU prints F1AP listening/binding, and DU logs `F1 Setup Response received` followed by radio activation. Then UE should connect to RFsim server and proceed with RRC.
- **Validation checks**:
  - Confirm CU logs show `Starting F1AP at CU` and SCTP server bound to the configured IP.
  - Confirm DU stops retrying SCTP and proceeds to `Activating gNB`.
  - Confirm UE connects to `127.0.0.1:4043` successfully and starts receiving SSB.

- **Corrected config snippets** (illustrative). Keep IPs/other params as in your environment; only the `gNB_ID` changes to a valid value. Comments highlight the change.

- **If issues persist**:
  - Search specs for identifier ranges: 3GPP TS 38.413 (NGAP)/38.473 (F1AP) for node IDs; 38.331/38.211 for cell identity composition. Verify the bit length used in your build and ensure `gNB_ID` conforms.
  - Enable higher logging for ASN.1/F1AP at CU to catch encoding failures tied to invalid `gNB_ID`.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not include explicit CU error messages indicating `gNB_ID` rejection; the conclusion is drawn from the misconfigured parameter provided, CU not starting F1AP, and DU connection refusals.
- Exact valid `gNB_ID` bit length may vary (22–32) per deployment/config; OAI commonly expects 22-bit. Choose a value well within range and keep CU/DU consistent.
- RFsim/port/IP values are inferred from logs; ensure they match your environment.
