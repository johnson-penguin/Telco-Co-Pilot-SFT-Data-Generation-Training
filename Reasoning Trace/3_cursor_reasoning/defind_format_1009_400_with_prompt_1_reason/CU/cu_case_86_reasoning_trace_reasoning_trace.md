## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
Based on the logs, this is an OAI SA deployment using rfsim:
- CU fails during configuration parsing and aborts initialization.
- DU brings up PHY/MAC, then repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (F1-C) at 127.0.0.5.
- UE starts and repeatedly fails to connect to the rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 (which would be hosted by the gNB process when fully up).

Expected successful flow in rfsim SA:
- CU parses `gnb.conf` → initializes RRC/NGAP/F1C → listens for DU F1 setup and creates rfsim server.
- DU initializes PHY/MAC → F1AP association to CU → activates radio and enters steady state.
- UE synchronizes to SSB → performs PRACH/RACH → RRC connection → NAS/NGAP → PDU session.

Input misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- In 5G NR, the gNB ID used in NR cell identity is limited to 22 bits (3GPP TS 38.331/38.413 context; NRCellIdentity is 36 bits = 22-bit gNB ID + 14-bit gNB DU cell identity). Value `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits all-ones) exceeds the allowed bit width. In OAI, this triggers config parse/validation failure.

From network_config (gnb_conf/ue_conf):
- We infer typical parameters consistent with logs: TDD band n78 around 3619.2 MHz, `absoluteFrequencySSB=641280`, `N_RB=106`, and likely `rfsimulator` enabled. The DU logs show F1-C DU IP `127.0.0.3` connecting to CU `127.0.0.5`, and band/frequency lines match UE.
- Immediate mismatch: CU cannot parse its config (syntax error), caused by the out-of-range `gNB_ID`, so CU never starts. Everything else stalls as a consequence.

Conclusion for setup: This is an SA rfsim topology where the CU is down due to an invalid `gNB_ID`, causing DU’s F1 SCTP failures and UE’s rfsim connection failures.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Key CU entries:
- `[LIBCONFIG] ... cu_case_86.conf - line 76: syntax error`
- `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`
- `init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed`
- `CMDLINE: ... nr-softmodem --rfsim --sa -O ... cu_case_86.conf`
- `function config_libconfig_init returned -1`

Interpretation:
- The CU fails before any RRC/NGAP/F1 initialization due to a configuration parse/validation error. In OAI, `gNBs.gNB_ID` is validated against allowed ranges and types; extreme values (like `0xFFFFFFFF`) can either be rejected by schema checks or overflow when mapped to internal structs, surfacing as a libconfig syntax/validation error.
- Because the CU does not start listening on F1-C or create the rfsim server, downstream components cannot attach.

Cross-reference to config:
- DU attempts F1-C to CU IP `127.0.0.5` (seen later). CU is not present to accept SCTP; hence repeated “Connection refused.”

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Highlights:
- Full PHY/MAC init, TDD config, frequencies: band n78 centered at 3619.2 MHz, `N_RB=106`, MU 1.
- `F1AP: gNB_DU_id 3584, ...` and F1-C addresses: DU `127.0.0.3` → CU `127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and `[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...`.
- “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.”

Interpretation:
- DU is healthy at PHY/MAC but cannot progress to active radio without F1 Setup Response from CU.
- The DU’s state is gated on CU responsiveness; failures correlate directly with CU being down.

Link to gNB config:
- No DU-side PRACH/PHY misconfig is indicated. The primary blocker is F1 connectivity to CU, which is unavailable because CU never passed configuration.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
Highlights:
- DL/UL frequencies and numerology match DU (`3619200000 Hz`, MU 1, `N_RB_DL 106`).
- Repeated attempts to connect to rfsim server: `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` → `errno(111)`.

Interpretation:
- In OAI rfsim, the gNB process (CU/DU stack in rfsim mode) provides the simulator server the UE connects to.
- Because CU never fully initializes, the rfsim server is not up. Therefore the UE cannot connect, producing repeated `ECONNREFUSED`.

Link to ue_conf:
- The UE’s frequencies and rfsimulator settings appear consistent; the problem is environmental (server absent), not UE parameter mismatch.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Root cause guided by `misconfigured_param`: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid for NR; the gNB ID must fit within 22 bits. This causes CU configuration parsing/validation to fail and abort startup.
- Consequence chain:
  - CU down → F1-C SCTP “Connection refused” at DU.
  - gNB/rfsim server not created → UE cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 (errno 111).
- No other anomalies (e.g., PRACH assertions, TDD misconfig) are present; everything derives from the CU’s fatal config error.

External standards knowledge:
- 3GPP NRCellIdentity is 36 bits: gNB ID (22 bits) + cell identity (up to 14 bits). Values outside the 22-bit range for gNB ID are invalid. OAI typically enforces this via config schema and/or runtime checks.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid 22-bit value. Examples: `0x1`, `0x12345`, or decimal equivalents within range (0..0x3FFFFF).
- Ensure consistency if multiple cells or DUs rely on derived identities.

Validation steps after change:
- Restart CU; confirm no libconfig errors.
- Observe CU starting F1-C listener and rfsim server.
- DU should establish F1 connection (no more SCTP refused; see F1 Setup Response and activation of radio).
- UE should connect to rfsim server and proceed to SSB sync, RACH, RRC connection.

Optional hardening:
- Add a config sanity check pass to fail-fast with explicit message: “gNB_ID must be <= 22 bits.”
- Keep CU/DU F1-C IPs consistent (`127.0.0.5` for CU, `127.0.0.3` for DU), and ensure ports are not blocked.

Proposed corrected snippets (illustrative) inside `network_config` structure:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      // FIX: gNB_ID must be 22-bit; changed from 0xFFFFFFFF (invalid) to 0x12345
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x12345"
      },
      // Ensure CU F1-C listens on this IP if DU expects 127.0.0.5
      "F1AP": {
        "CU_IPv4": "127.0.0.5",
        "DU_IPv4": "127.0.0.3"
      },
      // Other values consistent with logs (example placeholders)
      "NR_frequency": {
        "absoluteFrequencySSB": 641280,
        "dl_center_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "band": 78,
        "N_RB": 106,
        "mu": 1
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // UE parameters are consistent; no change required for this issue
      "rf": {
        "dl_center_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "duplex_mode": "TDD",
        "numerology": 1,
        "N_RB_DL": 106
      },
      "rfsimulator": {
        // Ensure UE points to the same host where gNB rfsim server runs
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Further analysis if issues persist after fix:
- If CU still fails: enable higher log verbosity for config parsing and validate the exact line containing `gNB_ID`.
- Confirm no stray characters or formatting (e.g., missing semicolon or quotes) on that line.
- Verify that DU and CU F1-C configs match (IP/port). Observe F1 Setup in both logs.
- Confirm the rfsim server logs from CU after startup; UE should stop showing `errno(111)`.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps, so exact sequencing is inferred.
- The provided `network_config` JSON is summarized; exact key paths in your real `gnb.conf` may differ slightly.
- The standards rationale relies on 3GPP constraints for NRCellIdentity/gNB ID width; implementation specifics may vary, but the CU failure is clearly tied to the invalid `gNB_ID` and matches the observed cascading failures.
