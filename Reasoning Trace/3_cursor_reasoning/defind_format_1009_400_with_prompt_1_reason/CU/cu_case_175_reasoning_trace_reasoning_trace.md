## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The deployment is OAI 5G NR SA mode using RFsim. Logs show CU and DU launched with `--rfsim --sa`, and a UE attempting to connect to the simulator server on `127.0.0.1:4043`. Expected flow: initialize components → CU listens for DU over F1-C (SCTP) → F1 Setup → CU connects to AMF (NGAP) → DU activates radio → UE connects via RFsim → PRACH → RRC attach and PDU session.

Guiding signal from misconfigured_param: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In NR, the `gNB-ID` carried in F1AP/NGAP is a bounded bit string with a configured length; using an all-ones 32-bit value typically violates the configured length/range and is treated as invalid. An invalid `gNB_ID` at CU can cause identity construction failures, preventing SCTP listener bring-up for F1-C/NGAP, which then cascades into DU connection refusal and UE RFsim failures.

Network configuration (from logs and the provided structure):
- gnb_conf (effective parameters observed):
  - `gNB_CU_id` shows as 3584 in CU log.
  - DU shows TDD with μ=1, N_RB=106, ABSFREQSSB 641280 (3619.2 MHz), PointA 640008.
  - F1-C addressing: DU tries DU `127.0.0.3` → CU `127.0.0.5` and binds GTP to `127.0.0.3`.
- ue_conf:
  - RF parameters match gNB: DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB=106.
  - RFsim client tries `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Initial mismatch: DU repeatedly gets SCTP connection refused to CU, and UE cannot connect to RFsim server. Both indicate CU didn’t complete bring-up (no F1-C listener, no RFsim server), aligning with a fatal config error early in CU init. The misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is the prime candidate.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- SA mode confirmed, build hash `b2c9a1d2b5`.
- CU-only context: `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` (expected for split CU/DU).
- Identity hints: `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- Config parsing proceeds; a non-fatal warning appears: `unknown ciphering algorithm "nea9"`.
- Missing expected events: no SCTP F1-C listener up, no F1 Setup handling, no NGAP/AMF connection. This pattern implies CU aborted or skipped application bring-up after reading configuration.

Interpretation: An invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` causes failure to construct legal identities (NR CGI, F1AP node IDs, NGAP IDs), leading to CU not starting F1-C and NGAP tasks. That directly explains downstream refusals.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU PHY/MAC/RU initialize cleanly: TDD pattern, SIB1, GTP-U init all shown; no PHY asserts.
- F1AP attempts: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5` → `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` with retries.
- DU remains `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.

Conclusion: DU is healthy but cannot associate because CU doesn’t listen. Root cause is thus upstream at CU, not DU PHY/MAC configuration.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE RF parameters match the DU/gNB: 3619.2 MHz, N_RB=106, μ=1; threads and HW configured.
- Repeated RFsim client connection attempts to `127.0.0.1:4043` fail with errno 111 (connection refused), meaning no server socket is listening.

Conclusion: RFsim server is not up because the gNB side is not in an operational state (DU is blocked by F1, CU likely aborted), so UE cannot progress to PRACH/RRC.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- CU does not expose F1-C or NGAP listeners; DU’s SCTP connects are refused, and UE’s RFsim connects are refused. This synchronizes around CU bring-up failure.
- The configured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid/out-of-range for the configured bit-length, breaking identity setup in OAI and preventing CU task activation.
- Therefore, the root cause is the invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` value in `gnb.conf` causing CU initialization to not complete, resulting in F1-C setup failure and UE RFsim connection failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Immediate fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within the configured bit-length and unique in the deployment. Use a reasonable non-all-ones value consistent with OAI samples, e.g., decimal `3584` or hex `0x00000DFF`.
- Ensure PLMN/TAC and NRCellID composition are consistent between CU/DU and SIB signaling.

  }
}
```

Operational validation steps:
- Restart CU with the corrected `gNB_ID`. Verify logs show F1AP server listening and NGAP task starting. Then start DU and confirm F1 Setup completes. Finally, start UE and confirm RFsim connects and PRACH/RRC proceed.
- If any residual issues: verify NRCellID bit composition (gNB-ID + cell ID bits) and PLMN/TAC encoding; check AMF parameters if NGAP has issues.

## 7. Limitations
- CU logs provided do not explicitly show the exact error message for `gNB_ID`; inference is based on the known misconfigured parameter and correlated symptoms across DU and UE. The exact valid bit-length for `gNB_ID` depends on deployment configuration; choose a value that fits and is unique. Spec references: 3GPP TS 38.413 (NGAP) for `gNB-ID` encoding and OAI sample `gnb.conf` values.
