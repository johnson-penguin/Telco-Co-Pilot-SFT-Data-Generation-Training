## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

We analyze an OAI 5G NR Standalone deployment in RF simulator mode, guided by the command line shown in CU logs (nr-softmodem with `--rfsim --sa`). The expected flow is: component initialization (CU/DU/UE) → F1 setup (DU↔CU over SCTP) → SIB1 broadcast and PRACH → RRC connection and registration → PDU Session. In rfsim, the DU acts as RF server and the UE connects as client to `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Network configuration (from provided JSON) highlights a misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. gNB ID length depends on the PLMN and gNB ID size fields but, in OAI, the configured `gNB_ID` is expected to fit within the allowed bit length used to compose the NR Cell Global ID (NR-CGI) and the F1AP/NGAP identities. A value of `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds typical supported sizes and can cause parsing/validation failures in libconfig-based loaders or later ASN.1 encoders.

Initial observations vs logs:
- CU logs show an early configuration parse failure (libconfig syntax error) and abort. This prevents F1-C from listening/accepting connections.
- DU logs show repeated SCTP connect failures to the CU (`Connection refused`), consistent with CU not up.
- UE logs show repeated rfsim connection attempts to `127.0.0.1:4043` with refusal (errno 111), consistent with the DU not activating radio because F1 Setup never completes.

Therefore, the system stalls before RF activation and before any PRACH or RRC signaling. The misconfigured `gNB_ID` is the guidepost for root cause.

Key params parsed from context:
- gnb_conf: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` (invalid/out-of-range for OAI expectations)
- ue_conf: not provided; UE uses DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, SCS µ=1, N_RB=106 (from logs), and rfsim client to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Potential issue set: invalid identity fields causing config parsing failure; F1/NGAP identity derivation issues; no PRACH due to non-activated DU (blocked on F1 Setup Response).

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- `[LIBCONFIG] ... cu_case_91.conf - line 85: syntax error` → config parser halts.
- `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded` and `init aborted` → CU never initializes tasks, sockets, or F1-C SCTP listener.
- Command line shows `--rfsim --sa -O ... cu_case_91.conf`.

Interpretation: Even if the line reports a generic “syntax error,” experience with OAI error-confs shows that out-of-range or malformed values for identity fields (e.g., `gNB_ID`) often lead to parse/semantic validation failures that surface as libconfig errors. With CU aborted, F1-C endpoint is not created and NGAP is not brought up.

Cross-ref to config: The misconfigured `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is the prime suspect; when corrected to a valid bit-length value (e.g., <= 24 bits, or consistent with configured `gNB_ID_bits`), CU parses and continues.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

DU initializes PHY/MAC and builds TDD configuration and frequencies correctly, then attempts F1-C:
- `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and `retrying...`
- `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`

Interpretation: DU is healthy enough to start, but cannot connect to CU because CU never bound/listened due to its config failure. Consequently, DU does not activate radio (typical OAI gating on F1 Setup), so rfsim server-side is not ready for UE.

Link to gnb_conf: The DU’s behavior is a downstream symptom of CU failure triggered by invalid `gNB_ID`.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE initializes PHY for 3.6192 GHz, µ=1, N_RB=106, TDD mode. It is an rfsim client.
- Repeated lines: `Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043` → `connect() ... failed, errno(111)`.

Interpretation: rfsim client cannot connect because server is not accepting connections. In OAI rfsim SA, the server side is typically created by the DU process once it activates radio after F1 Setup with CU. Since F1 fails (CU down), UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- T0: CU attempts to load config → fails early on parse error.
- T1: DU starts and tries F1-C to CU at 127.0.0.5 → connection refused repeatedly.
- T2: DU stays in "waiting for F1 Setup Response" → radio not activated → rfsim server not listening.
- T3: UE, as rfsim client, repeatedly gets `ECONNREFUSED` to 127.0.0.1:4043.

Guided by misconfigured_param, the plausible mechanism is: `gNB_ID` set to `0xFFFFFFFF` violates OAI’s expected gNB ID bit-length/format, leading to a libconfig parse/validation error that aborts CU. Without CU, DU cannot complete F1 Setup; without F1, rfsim server is not brought up; consequently UE cannot connect. No lower-layer PHY/PRACH mismatch is required to explain the observed behavior.

Spec/OAI alignment:
- In NR, gNB identity contributes to NG-RAN node identity and NR-CGI composition. Implementations (including OAI) often constrain configured `gNB_ID` to specific bit lengths (commonly up to 24 bits) matching the SIB and F1/NGAP encoding paths. `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits all ones) exceeds such limits and is prone to rejection.

Root cause: Invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` causing CU configuration load failure.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Configuration fixes:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value consistent with OAI expectations (e.g., within 24 bits). Also ensure any associated `gNB_ID_bits` or cell identity fields (if present) are consistent.

Suggested corrected snippets (JSON-style representation of intended config fields):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001" // Fix: within supported bit-length
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change required from logs; ensure rfsimulator server matches DU host:port if customized
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Correct CU config and restart CU → verify no libconfig errors.
- Start DU → confirm F1 Setup succeeds (F1 Setup Request/Response).
- Ensure DU activates radio (log: activating RU/threads) and rfsim server listens.
- Start UE → verify rfsim client connects, SSB detected, PRACH, RRC connection request.

Further checks if issues persist:
- If another parse error: validate adjacent fields around original line 85 for commas/braces.
- Confirm IPs/ports: DU F1-C target 127.0.0.5 must match CU bind; rfsim port defaults to 4043 unless changed.
- If identities are encoded in SIBs: ensure cellIdentity fits expected bit-length for NR-CGI.

## 7. Limitations

- The provided JSON omits full `gnb_conf`/`ue_conf` objects; we infer behavior from logs and the flagged parameter.
- CU error reports a generic syntax error; we attribute it to invalid `gNB_ID` per the misconfigured_param and OAI patterns, but the exact line content is not shown.
- Logs are truncated (no CU stacktrace), so secondary issues (if any) after fixing `gNB_ID` are not visible here.
