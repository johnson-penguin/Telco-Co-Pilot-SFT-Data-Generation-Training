## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
We are in OAI 5G NR SA mode with RF simulator. CU and DU start separately; UE is an rfsim client. Expected flow: components init → CU establishes NGAP with AMF → DU establishes F1-C with CU → DU activates radio (F1 Setup Response) → UE connects to rfsim server (DU) → PRACH/RRC attach → PDU session.

Network configuration and key params (guided by misconfigured_param):
- misconfigured_param: gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF
- From logs and typical OAI defaults:
  - CU shows NGAP macro gNB id 3584 (0xE00) and logs “3584 -> 0000e000”, indicating OAI masked the configured gNB_ID down to a limited bit-length before encoding.
  - DU uses gNB_DU_id 3584 as well.
- DU/UE frequencies align at 3619200000 Hz; TDD config present; UE uses rfsimulator_serveraddr 127.0.0.1.

Initial suspicion from misconfigured_param: 0xFFFFFFFF is out of the 3GPP-allowed gNB-ID bit-length (38.413 specifies gNB-ID length 22 bits; networks typically use ≤ 20–22 bits). OAI likely masks/truncates to the allowed length. Such truncation can break identity-derived bindings and control-plane bring-up, e.g., preventing F1 server startup or causing mismatched keys across CU/DU contexts.

Potential issues to look for: F1-C SCTP setup failures, CU not listening on F1-C, DU waiting for F1 Setup Response (so radio inactive), UE unable to connect to rfsim server as a downstream symptom.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
Highlights:
- SA mode confirmed; NGAP/AMF configured to 192.168.8.43.
- NGAP succeeds: “Send NGSetupRequest … Received NGSetupResponse”.
- CU logs: “Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584” and “3584 -> 0000e000”. This shows the configured gNB_ID (0xFFFFFFFF) was not used as-is; it was mapped/masked to 3584 before NGAP encoding. This is consistent with enforcing a 22-bit gNB-ID length field.

Notable absence and implications:
- No explicit CU-side F1AP server/listener start log lines. In healthy runs, CU-CP should announce F1C task/listener. If identity validation or configuration parsing fails, CU may skip bringing up F1-C.
- CU proceeds with NGAP/GTpU threads, but the F1-C endpoint appears absent from CU logs. That aligns with DU’s repeated SCTP “connection refused” below (i.e., no listener).

Relevance to gNB_ID: If gNB identity is invalid, OAI may sanitize it internally for NGAP but still prevent complete CU role activation, particularly F1-C, due to inconsistent identity state between config, RRC/NGAP contexts, and F1 manager.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
Initialization is nominal: PHY/MAC configured, TDD pattern established, frequency 3619200000 Hz, cell setup info printed. Then:
- DU F1AP client attempts SCTP to CU: “F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5”.
- Repeated: “SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused” and “Received unsuccessful result … retrying…”.
- DU prints: “waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio” and never activates radio.

Interpretation:
- “Connection refused” is a TCP/SCTP socket-level error indicating the CU side is not listening on the target IP/port. This is not an ID-mismatch rejection at F1AP layer; it is absence of a server.
- Given CU logs lack F1AP server startup, this matches DU’s refusal errors.

Relevance to gNB_ID: The invalid gNB_ID can prevent the CU’s F1-C server from starting (e.g., identity validation fails or the CU enters a partial-init state where NGAP is up but F1-C is not). The DU, configured to use ID 3584 and connect to CU 127.0.0.5, keeps retrying, but the CU side is closed.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
UE initializes PHY with N_RB_DL 106 at 3619200000 Hz. Then:
- UE is an rfsim client: tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, “errno(111)” (connection refused).
- This port is provided by the DU’s rfsim server once radio is activated. Since the DU is waiting for F1 Setup Response, the DU never activates radio nor starts/accepts rfsim connections → UE can’t connect.

Relevance chain: UE failure is a downstream symptom of DU inactivity, which is caused by DU’s inability to establish F1-C, which in turn traces to CU not listening—consistent with a CU-side misconfig rooted in gNB_ID invalidity.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU reaches NGAP Ready but appears not to start F1-C.
- DU repeatedly fails SCTP to CU (connection refused) and waits for F1 Setup Response → radio inactive.
- UE can’t connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 because DU never activates.

Identity analysis guided by misconfigured_param:
- Configured gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF exceeds 22-bit gNB-ID length (3GPP TS 38.413). OAI masks/truncates, evidenced by CU logging macro gNB id 3584 (0xE00) and “0000e000”.
- Such truncation creates divergence between configured and effective identities and can poison internal keying/registration of components (e.g., F1 manager), leading CU to skip or fail F1-C bring-up while NGAP still proceeds using the masked value. The observable net effect is exactly what we see: NGAP works, F1-C doesn’t exist; DU cannot connect; UE cannot progress.

Root cause:
- The misconfigured gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF (out of spec) causes CU-side identity handling to sanitize/mask the value for NGAP while preventing or breaking F1-C initialization. This leaves no F1-C listener on CU, so DU’s SCTP attempts are refused. Consequently, DU never activates radio and the UE cannot attach or even connect to rfsim.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within the allowed bit-length (≤ 22 bits). Choose a small, unambiguous value matching deployments across CU and DU, e.g., 3584 (0xE00) or any unique ID in range [1 .. (2^22 − 1)]. Ensure CU and DU use consistent identities.

    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps after change:
- Restart CU; verify CU logs show F1AP listener startup. Look for explicit lines indicating F1-C task creation/listen.
- Restart DU; confirm SCTP connects (no “connection refused”), and DU logs progress beyond “waiting for F1 Setup Response”. Radio should activate.
- Then start UE; rfsim client should connect, followed by PRACH, RACH completion, RRC setup, and PDU session establishment.

Further checks/tools:
- If still refused, validate CU bind address/loopback accessibility and that `CU_CP_IPv4` matches DU’s `CU` target IP.
- Confirm no other components are bound to the SCTP port.
- Optionally enable higher log verbosity on F1AP for both CU/DU to confirm identity matching.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and omit explicit CU F1AP startup lines and any fatal messages about identity validation, so we infer from symptoms (SCTP refused) and the known misconfigured_param.
- Exact 3GPP limits: gNB-ID is encoded with a configured bit-length (commonly 22 bits) per 38.413; precise implementation in OAI may mask to its internal maximum. We rely on observed masking (3584) to conclude the configured value was out-of-range.
- If the CU/DU are not actually co-hosted or loopback is firewalled, networking could also cause “connection refused”. However, given the guided misconfigured_param and consistent masking evidence, the identity range violation is the primary, actionable cause.
