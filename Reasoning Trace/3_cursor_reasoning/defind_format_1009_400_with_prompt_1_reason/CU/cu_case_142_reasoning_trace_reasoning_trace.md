## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- **Scenario**: OAI 5G NR Standalone (SA) with RF simulator. Logs show `--rfsim --sa` on CU/DU and UE attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- **Expected flow**: Init (threads, GTP-U, NR PHY/MAC) → F1AP (DU↔CU) and time source setup → CU NGAP ready (not shown here) → DU operational → UE sync/PRACH/RACH → RRC setup → PDU session.
- **Misconfigured parameter (given)**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
- **Why this is suspicious**: NGAP Global gNB ID uses a gNB ID up to 22 bits (per 3GPP TS 38.413/23.003 conventions). `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits all ones) exceeds 22-bit range and is often rejected or masked, leading to identity inconsistencies between F1 and NGAP contexts.

Network configuration key points inferred from logs and typical `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf`:
- `gnb_conf` (from DU logs): band 78 settings at 3619.2 MHz, TDD config, SSB at 641280, DU announces `gNB_DU_id 3584`, TAC 1, MCC/MNC likely 001/01 on DU side. CU RRC shows PLMN 000/0.
- `ue_conf`: RF at 3619.2 MHz, TDD, connecting to RFSim server `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Initial mismatch hints: CU reports PLMN mismatch (CU 000/0 vs DU 001/01), and later F1 SCTP teardown. The invalid `gNB_ID` can cause malformed Global IDs and trigger control-plane setup failures.

---

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- Init OK: SA mode, threads, GTP-U bound to `192.168.8.43:2152` and later `127.0.0.5:2152` for local testing, F1AP starting at CU.
- Events:
  - `[NR_RRC] PLMNs received from CUUP (1/1) did not match RRC (0/0)` → CU-side PLMN misconfig.
  - CU receives F1 Setup Request from DU `3584` then logs: `[NR_RRC] PLMN mismatch: CU 000.0, DU 00101`.
  - SCTP SHUTDOWN and endpoint removal follow; CU notes no DU connected.
- Cross-ref to config:
  - PLMN mismatch is explicit; while not directly caused by `gNB_ID`, a bad Global gNB ID can also poison F1/NGAP identity handling. Here, F1 setup progressed to request reception, so PLMN mismatch alone is a blocker; however, `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` remains invalid and must be fixed.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- PHY/MAC init healthy: TDD config, N_RB=106, band 48/78 logs at 3619.2 MHz, SIB1 freq parsed, antenna config displayed.
- F1-C: DU connects to CU `127.0.0.5`, GTP bound `127.0.0.3`.
- Critical line: `[MAC] the CU reported F1AP Setup Failure, is there a configuration mismatch?` → aligns with CU’s PLMN mismatch.
- DU identity: `gNB_DU_id 3584`, cellID 1, TAC 1, MCC/MNC 1/1/2 (i.e., `001/01`). If `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` was applied, the encoded Global IDs at CU or DU can be inconsistent. Even if F1 uses gNB-DU ID (local), the CU also forms Global gNB ID combining PLMN and gNB ID; invalid gNB ID can trigger validation failures or be masked, worsening mismatches.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- UE RF setup matches gNB (3619.2 MHz, TDD, 106 PRBs). Repeated failures to connect to RFSim server `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)` show the RFSim server is not up from gNB side (DU/CU did not reach operational RF state due to control-plane setup failure). Thus, UE can’t proceed to PRACH.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- Timeline: DU boots and attempts F1 setup → CU rejects with PLMN mismatch → F1 SCTP teardown → DU not operational at RFSim level → UE cannot connect to server 4043.
- Root cause intertwined:
  - **Primary visible blocker**: PLMN mismatch between CU and DU.
  - **Given misconfigured_param**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid ( > 22-bit range). This causes malformed/invalid Global gNB ID in NGAP/F1 contexts and can lead to CU-side checks failing or inconsistent identity handling. Even after fixing PLMN, leaving `gNB_ID` at `0xFFFFFFFF` risks further failures in NGAP or logging/encoding.
- Therefore, to restore normal operation, fix both:
  - Set a valid `gNB_ID` within 22-bit range, e.g., `1` (or any 0..4194303) consistently on CU and DU.
  - Align PLMN (MCC/MNC) across CU, DU, and UE to `001/01` (as DU advertises).

---

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

- Config changes (apply to both CU and DU `gnb.conf`):
  - Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value (example `1`).
  - Ensure `mcc: "001"`, `mnc: "01"` consistently in RRC and CUUP.
  - Confirm F1 addresses: CU `127.0.0.5`, DU `127.0.0.3` as in logs.
- UE config:
  - Keep frequency and numerology as-is; ensure `rfsimulator_serveraddr: "127.0.0.1"` and `rfsimulator_serverport: 4043`.
- Operational checks:
  - After edits, restart CU then DU; verify CU logs show successful F1 Setup; DU should not print F1 Setup Failure; UE should connect to RFSim server then detect SSB.
  - If issues persist, enable verbose F1AP/NGAP logs and inspect Global gNB ID encoding.

Corrected configuration snippets (JSON-like with comments):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "mcc": "001",            // Align with DU and UE
        "mnc": "01",             // Align with DU and UE
        "gNB_ID": 1               // FIX: replace 0xFFFFFFFF with a valid 22-bit value
      },
      "F1": {
        "CU_IPv4": "127.0.0.5",  // CU side address as in logs
        "DU_IPv4": "127.0.0.3"
      }
      // Other radio params unchanged (band/numerology/SSB)
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "n_rb_dl": 106,
        "duplex_mode": "TDD"
      },
      "rfsim": {
        "server_addr": "127.0.0.1",
        "server_port": 4043
      },
      "plmn": {
        "mcc": "001",            // Align with gNB
        "mnc": "01"              // Align with gNB
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- If your deployment uses explicit `plmn_list`/`cellConfigCommon` structures, mirror the MCC/MNC there as well.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are truncated and do not show NGAP end-to-end; conclusion on gNB ID validity is based on 3GPP constraints and common OAI behavior with Global gNB ID encoding.
- The exact config JSON was not provided; snippets above illustrate the minimal fixes required.
- Additional mismatches (e.g., CUUP PLMN vs RRC) must also be aligned to avoid E1AP failures.
