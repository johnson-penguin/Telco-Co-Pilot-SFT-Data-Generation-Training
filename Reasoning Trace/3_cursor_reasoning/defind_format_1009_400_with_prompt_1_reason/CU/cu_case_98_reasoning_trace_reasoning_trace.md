## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

- **Mode and topology**: The logs show SA mode with RF simulator (rfsim) enabled for both CU/DU and UE. Expected sequence: component init → F1AP setup (DU↔CU) → NGAP setup (CU↔AMF) → UE attach (PRACH/RRC) → PDU session.
- **Key inputs**:
  - **misconfigured_param**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - **CU logs**: SA+rfsim, config parsing, F1 identifiers printed, warning about security cipher algorithm, no clear NGAP progress.
  - **DU logs**: Full PHY/MAC init, TDD configured, F1AP client repeatedly fails SCTP connect with “Connection refused”, DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio.
  - **UE logs**: RFsim client repeatedly fails to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (errno 111), indicating no server listening on the gNB side.
- **Initial hypothesis from misconfigured_param**: An invalid or out-of-range `gNB_ID` corrupts gNB identity signaling/derivations (F1 Setup, NG Setup, cell identity composition), preventing CU from accepting F1 association. DU sees SCTP connection refused; UE cannot connect because rfsim server in DU side does not fully start without F1 activation.
- **Network config extraction (inferred from logs and typical OAI config)**:
  - `gnb_conf`: contains `gNBs.gNB_ID` (set to `0xFFFFFFFF`), F1 addresses: DU uses F1-C DU `127.0.0.3` → CU `127.0.0.5`; band/numerology/dl_freq consistent (3619.2 MHz, N_RB 106, μ=1), TDD pattern OK.
  - `ue_conf`: IMSI not shown; RFsim server address expected `127.0.0.1:4043`.

Notes: In NGAP (TS 38.413) the `gNB-ID` IE is a BIT STRING sized 22..32 bits. OAI additionally composes the 36-bit NR Cell Identity from `gNB_ID` and `cellLocalId` and encodes it into SIB/NGAP. Extreme values and mismatched bit-length settings can break validation and cause association/setup rejection. A value of `0xFFFFFFFF` (all 1s over 32 bits) is at the limit and commonly incompatible with default bit-length assumptions (e.g., OAI often expects 22-bit gNB IDs unless explicitly configured), leading to encoding or policy failures at CU.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

- **Init/versions**: SA+rfsim confirmed; build info present. RAN context shows CU-only instantiation (no MAC/L1/RU in CU):
  - `[GNB_APP] Initialized RAN Context: RC.nb_nr_inst = 1, ... RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0, RC.nb_RU = 0`.
- **F1 identifiers**:
  - `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- **Config parsing**: Multiple reads of `GNBSParams`, `SCTPParams`, measurement event params.
- **Warning**:
  - `[RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm "0" in section "security"` — mis-set security, but non-fatal at this stage.
- **Missing progress**:
  - No `TASK_SCTP listening` or `F1AP: association established` lines. If the CU fails internal checks (e.g., identity/ASN.1 encode), it may not bind/listen on F1-C (`127.0.0.5`), which matches DU’s repeated “Connection refused”.
- **Relevance to `gNB_ID`**:
  - CU is where NGAP node identity and NR cell identity are encoded and validated. An out-of-bounds or bit-length-incompatible `gNB_ID` can cause CU-side failure to proceed to F1 listen/accept state, explaining DU’s SCTP refused.

---

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

- **Init**: DU initializes PHY/MAC/L1 and configures TDD successfully; RF parameters match UE (3619200000 Hz, μ=1, N_RB=106). SIB1 frequency/pointA logged, antenna numbers set, HARQ configured.
- **F1AP behavior**:
  - F1 client starts: `F1AP: Starting F1AP at DU` and attempts `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5`.
  - Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and `[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result ... retrying...`.
  - DU prints: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` — radio activation gated by F1 setup.
- **Interpretation**:
  - SCTP refused indicates the CU is not listening on `127.0.0.5:38472` (default F1-C). This aligns with CU failing to reach a state where it opens F1-C, likely due to config validation failure tied to `gNB_ID`.
- **Relation to `gNB_ID`**:
  - DU generally does not crash on `gNB_ID`; the CU’s acceptance of the F1 Setup Request (and even listening) depends on valid identity composition. If CU rejects/never starts, DU cannot proceed.

---

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

- **RF init**: UE configured for DL 3619.2 MHz, μ=1, N_RB 106, TDD; threads created.
- **RFsim connectivity**:
  - UE acts as RFsim client and repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
  - Errors: `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` — connection refused/target not listening.
- **Interpretation**:
  - RFsim server is brought up by the gNB (DU side). Because DU is waiting for F1 Setup and CU is not accepting, the gNB side never opens the RFsim server; hence UE cannot attach.

---

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

- **Timeline correlation**:
  - CU initializes but (likely) fails internal identity/config checks; no F1 listener.
  - DU initializes and repeatedly gets SCTP refused to CU F1-C.
  - UE fails to connect to RFsim server because DU never activates radio without F1 Setup.
- **Role of `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**:
  - NGAP `gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING (SIZE 22..32). OAI’s default `gNB_ID` handling commonly assumes 22 bits unless configured via `gNB_ID_bits`. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits all ones) can violate internal range/policy checks or produce invalid NR Cell Identity composition when combined with cell-local ID, TAC, and PLMN encoding.
  - Consequence: CU fails to start F1 listener or rejects association; DU sees connection refused; UE cannot connect to RFsim.
- **Supporting standards intuition**:
  - TS 38.413 (NGAP) specifies 22..32 bits for `gNB-ID`; TS 38.331/38.304 and OAI code compose NCI (36 bits) = gNB_ID (gNB-ID length) + cellLocalId. Using a maxed 32-bit gNB_ID leaves insufficient bits or mismatches default assumptions, triggering encoding failures.

Root cause: Misconfigured `gNB_ID` set to an extreme/invalid value (`0xFFFFFFFF`) leading to CU-side identity encoding/validation failure and thus no F1 service, cascading to DU/UE failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

1. **Set a valid, bounded `gNB_ID` with explicit bit length**
   - Choose a small, conventional value and align bit-length with OAI expectations (commonly 22 bits).
2. **Ensure CU listens on F1-C and DU can associate**
   - After fixing identity, verify CU logs show SCTP server bind and F1 Setup outcome, and DU logs show F1 Setup Success.
3. **Clean up security config**
   - Replace unknown ciphering algorithm "0" with a valid one (e.g., `nea0/nea1/nea2` and `nia0/nia1/nia2`) to avoid later attach issues.
4. **Validation checks**
   - Confirm NGAP setup with AMF and that RFsim server opens, allowing UE to connect.

Proposed corrected snippets (as JSON objects within `network_config`), comments explain changes:

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000A",          // Changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a safe 22-bit-sized value
        "gNB_ID_bits": 22               // Explicitly set to match OAI default expectations
      },
      "F1AP": {
        "localAddress": "127.0.0.5",   // CU listens here; ensure CU actually binds after fix
        "duPeerAddress": "127.0.0.3"
      },
      "security": {
        "integrity": "nia2",           // Avoid "unknown ciphering algorithm \"0\""
        "ciphering": "nea2"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
      "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043,
      "dl_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
      "numerology": 1,
      "N_RB_DL": 106
    }
  }
}
```

Operational steps:
- Update CU and DU configs consistently for `gNB_ID` and (if present) `gNB_ID_bits`.
- Restart CU → confirm F1-C listener; start DU → confirm F1 Setup Success; start UE → confirm RFsim connection established; proceed to NGAP and attach.

## 7. Limitations

- Logs are partial (no CU F1/NGAP bind lines, no explicit ASN.1 error printouts). The diagnosis relies on the provided misconfigured parameter and the consistent symptom pattern (SCTP refused at DU; RFsim refused at UE).
- Exact OAI constraints on `gNB_ID` can differ by branch; if issues persist, test values like `0x000001` or `0x00000A` and verify `gNB_ID_bits`. Also ensure NR Cell Identity length settings, TAC/PLMN composition, and any policy checks in OAI’s NGAP/F1AP stacks align with chosen lengths.
