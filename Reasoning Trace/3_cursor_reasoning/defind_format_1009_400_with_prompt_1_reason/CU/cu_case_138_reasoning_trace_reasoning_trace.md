## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The logs indicate OAI NR SA with rfsimulator: CU launched with `--rfsim --sa`, DU shows full PHY/MAC init but waits for F1, and UE runs rfsim client repeatedly attempting to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Expected SA/rfsim bring-up: CU starts → F1-C server up on CU → DU connects F1-C to CU and completes F1 Setup → DU activates radio/time source → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB decode/PRACH → RRC attach → (optionally NGAP/AMF if core is present, but not essential for this error).
- Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In OAI, `gNB_ID` is typically treated as a 22-bit (up to 32 supported by NGAP, but OAI defaults to 22) integer used to derive the NR cell identity and identifiers advertised over F1/NG. Value `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) exceeds the 22-bit maximum of 4194303 and commonly triggers range checks or internal masking, leading to failures early in CU initialization (e.g., building global gNB ID, cell ID, or F1/NG contexts).

Network configuration highlights (from `network_config`):
- gnb_conf (key params to watch for mismatches):
  - gNB ID: 0xFFFFFFFF (misconfigured; out of range for OAI's default expectations).
  - gNB_CU/DU IPs: DU tries F1-C → CU at `127.0.0.5`; DU binds `127.0.0.3` and GTPU `127.0.0.3:2152` (all consistent intra-host rfsim defaults).
  - RF numerology: `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280` → 3619200000 Hz (n78-like), `N_RB 106`, TDD config periodicity 5 ms; these align CU/DU/UE logs.
- ue_conf:
  - RF matches DU: DL/UL 3619200000 Hz, `mu=1`, `N_RB_DL=106`.
  - rfsimulator client attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly; server is not listening (because DU never activated radio due to F1 not established).

Initial mismatch noted: CU does not show F1AP startup/server bind logs; DU repeatedly gets SCTP connection refused to CU `127.0.0.5`. This is consistent with CU failing to fully initialize F1 due to the invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` value.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Mode/Build: SA mode, develop build `b2c9a1d2b5`.
- RAN context: `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0` → CU-only process (no MAC/L1 threads), as expected for split CU.
- F1AP context shows: `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU`.
- Warning: `unknown ciphering algorithm ""` (empty string) — usually non-fatal; OAI will pick defaults later or keep empty, not a blocker in rfsim bring-up.
- Config parsing proceeds (`config_libconfig_init returned 0`, multiple `Reading 'GNBSParams'` etc.).
- Missing expected lines: No log indicating F1AP server startup (e.g., bind/listen on CU F1-C), no NGAP/AMF connection attempts, no RRC cell config confirmation. This suggests initialization aborted after config parsing before protocol stacks started.
- Most plausible early-abort cause, guided by `misconfigured_param`: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` causing invalid global gNB identity setup. In OAI, this is used to compute NR cell identity and NG/F1 node identifiers; out-of-range value can trigger assertions or early returns, leaving no F1 server.

Cross-reference with config: DU attempts SCTP to CU at `127.0.0.5` and is refused → CU not listening → consistent with CU init failure.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Mode/Build: SA mode, same build.
- Init: Full PHY/MAC initialized; TDD period and RF parameters match UE: `DL 3619200000 Hz`, `N_RB 106`, `mu=1`, SIB1 parameters parsed.
- F1AP at DU: "Starting F1AP at DU"; attempts to connect F1-C to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated failures: `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by retries. DU remains in `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- There are no PHY assertion/crash logs; DU is healthy but blocked by F1 not established. Therefore the blocker is upstream (CU not ready/listening).
- gNB_DU_id shown as `3584`; this is fine. The DU's own IDs are not misconfigured; the problem is the CU side global gNB ID configuration.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- RF init: Matches DU config (3619200000 Hz, `N_RB_DL=106`, `mu=1`). Threads start as expected.
- RFSIM client behavior: "Running as client"; tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly; gets `errno(111)` connection refused. In OAI rfsim, the DU acts as the simulator server; if DU never activates radio (blocked pending F1 Setup), the rfsim server socket is not ready, resulting in UE connection refusals.
- No PRACH/SIB decode attempts appear; UE cannot proceed without rfsim link.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU parses config but does not bring up F1 server.
  - DU starts and repeatedly attempts F1-C SCTP to CU `127.0.0.5` → connection refused.
  - DU waits for F1 Setup Response; radio activation is deferred; hence rfsim server not started.
  - UE repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server at `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- Guided by misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`:
  - OAI typically expects `gNB_ID` to be within a 22-bit range by default (max 4194303). While NGAP allows up to 32-bit gNB-ID sizes, OAI config and internal computations (cell ID derivation, bit masks) often use 22-bit defaults unless explicitly configured for 32-bit length. Setting `0xFFFFFFFF` overflows these expectations.
  - Likely failure point: constructing Global gNB ID or NR CellIdentity during CU init (e.g., RRC cell config or NG/F1 identity setup). An out-of-range value can trigger validation failure or silent abort of subsequent stack bring-up, explaining absence of F1 server bind logs.
- Therefore, the root cause is the invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` value in CU configuration, preventing CU from starting F1AP properly, which cascades to DU being unable to connect, keeps DU radio inactive, and makes UE rfsim connection impossible.

Note on standards: 3GPP NGAP (TS 38.413) permits gNB-ID lengths between 22 and 32 bits; however, the implementation must be configured consistently (bit length and value). In OAI, leaving defaults while setting a 32-bit all-ones value is inconsistent with default 22-bit handling.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Primary fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a value within the supported bit-length configured in OAI (commonly 22-bit). Examples: `0x00000001`, `0x00000E00` (3584), or any value `< 0x00400000` (4194304).
- Ensure any associated "gNB ID length" or cell identity derivations (if present in your config/version) are consistent with the chosen value.

Suggested corrected snippets (within `network_config` structure):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      // Use a valid 22-bit gNB ID; previous value 0xFFFFFFFF was out of range
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000E00" // 3584, matches IDs seen in logs; < 2^22
      },
      // If your config supports explicit length, set it to 22 to match value range
      "gNB_ID_length_bits": 22,
      // Keep F1 and IP parameters unchanged (they matched in logs)
      "F1C": {
        "CU_IP": "127.0.0.5",
        "DU_IP": "127.0.0.3"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // No change required; RF and rfsim settings were consistent
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "mu": 1,
        "n_rb_dl": 106
      },
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "serverport": 4043
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Operational verification after the change:
- Start CU → confirm logs show F1AP server bind/listening and (optionally) NGAP setup.
- Start DU → verify F1 SCTP connects (no more connection refused), receive F1 Setup Response, and radio is activated.
- Confirm DU starts the rfsim server; UE then connects to `127.0.0.1:4043` successfully.
- Observe SSB detection, PRACH, RRC connection setup in UE logs.

Further analysis (if issues persist):
- If your deployment expects 32-bit IDs, ensure OAI version/config exposes and sets the gNB-ID bit length consistently (e.g., 32) and choose a value within that length which does not collide with masking assumptions elsewhere.
- Enable higher log verbosity for identity setup at CU (RRC and NGAP) to capture any residual validation errors.
- Verify that the CU actually binds F1-C on the configured IP; mismatches between config and DU target can also cause refused connections.

## 7. Limitations
- The provided JSON does not include the full `network_config` objects; the fix snippet assumes typical OAI key paths. Adjust field names to your actual conf JSON schema.
- CU logs are truncated and do not explicitly show the failure reason; the diagnosis is guided by the known misconfigured parameter and the systemic symptom of CU not listening on F1.
- Standards citation is summarized; exact OAI handling of gNB-ID length may vary by branch/commit. If uncertainty remains, consult your specific OAI version’s config parser and identity setup code to confirm enforced ranges and masks.
