## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The logs show OAI running in SA with RF simulator: CU/DU have `--rfsim --sa`; UE tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly.
- Expected flow: process init → NGAP toward AMF (CU) and F1-C between CU/DU → DU activates radio/time → UE connects via rfsim TCP → SSB detect/PRACH → RRC attach → PDU session.
- Provided misconfiguration: **`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`**.
  - In NGAP, Global gNB-ID is a bit string (22–32 bits). All-ones 32-bit value is borderline/invalid in practice and known to cause OAI encoding/mapping issues (macro ID truncation/collision). OAI often derives/display "macro gNB id" separate from configured `gNB_ID`.
  - We should expect mismatches between configured `gNB_ID` and the IDs printed/used by NGAP/F1, potentially impacting inter-component identity checks and SCTP associations.
- Network configuration cues inferred from logs:
  - CU: AMF address parsed as `abc.def.ghi.jkl` (invalid), GTPU at `192.168.8.43:2152`, CU F1 at `127.0.0.5` (from DU log target).
  - DU: F1-C DU `127.0.0.3` → CU `127.0.0.5`; TDD, `N_RB_DL=106`, DL freq `3619200000` Hz; waiting for F1 Setup Response before radio activation.
  - UE: DL freq `3619200000` Hz, numerology 1, `N_RB_DL=106`, rfsim client to `127.0.0.1:4043` failing (connection refused).
- Initial mismatches:
  - Configured `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` vs logs showing registered macro gNB id `3584` (dec) at CU; DU prints `gNB_DU_id 3584`. This implies truncation/mapping rather than honoring the configured value, which can create identity inconsistencies.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Init OK: SA mode, threads for NGAP/RRC/GTPU/F1, GTPU bound to `192.168.8.43:2152`.
- NGAP prints: "Registered new gNB[0] and macro gNB id 3584" and accepts new CU-UP with ID 3584; F1AP starting at CU.
- Fatal anomaly:
  - `Assertion (status == 0) failed! In sctp_handle_new_association_req() ... getaddrinfo(abc.def.ghi.jkl) failed: Name or service not known` → CU exits.
- Cross-reference:
  - Invalid AMF hostname is a hard blocker. Independently, the CU is operating with macro gNB id `3584`, not `0xFFFFFFFF`, indicating the configured value is either rejected or masked. If other components compute/use a different mapping, identity mismatches can surface later (e.g., NGAP GlobalRANNodeID, F1 Setup).

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- Init OK: PHY/MAC configured; TDD patterns, DL/UL freqs match UE; F1AP DU starts.
- F1-C: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated: `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` and `[F1AP] ... retrying...`. DU prints "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio".
- Implication: CU is down (exited on AMF DNS failure), so DU cannot form SCTP to `127.0.0.5`. Radio not activated; rfsim server not started, blocking UE.
- Identity: DU prints `gNB_DU_id 3584`. If CU expected a different ID mapping (due to misconfigured `gNB_ID`), post-DNS-fix this could still cause F1 Setup rejection or NGAP issues.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE RF configured for same band/frequency and numerology; spawns threads.
- Acts as rfsim client: repeatedly attempts `127.0.0.1:4043` and gets `errno(111)` connection refused → rfsim server (typically started by DU once active) is not listening because DU is waiting on F1 Setup (CU is down).

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU starts → tries NGAP to AMF → DNS failure on `abc.def.ghi.jkl` → CU asserts and exits.
  - DU tries F1 to CU `127.0.0.5` → refused (CU is down) → DU never activates radio nor rfsim server.
  - UE cannot connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` (no server) → repeated failures.
- Role of misconfigured parameter (`gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`):
  - NGAP/F1 identities in OAI are derived/validated against configured `gNB_ID`. Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (all ones) is outside typical deployment practice and can be invalid in ASN.1 encodings or internal masks (e.g., macro ID extraction). The logs already show the CU using macro ID 3584, not the configured value, implying truncation. This is a latent defect: even after fixing AMF DNS, identity inconsistency may lead to NGAP registration issues or F1 Setup failures (e.g., Global gNB ID IE malformed or inconsistent across CU/DU).
  - Therefore, while the immediate crash is the AMF DNS misconfiguration, the root-cause parameter for the requested case is the invalid `gNB_ID`, which must be corrected to ensure stable NGAP/F1 identity handling and inter-component consistency.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Config fixes (minimal set):
  - Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid small unique value (commonly 20–22 bit macro-style IDs are used). Example: `0x00000E00` to match the observed 3584 (0xE00), or simply `0x00000001` for clarity. Ensure the same is used consistently by CU/DU if both consume the same config namespace.
  - Replace invalid AMF hostname with a resolvable IP/DNS (e.g., `192.168.8.10`).
  - Ensure CU F1-C listens at the IP the DU targets (`127.0.0.5`) or align both to the same loopback or LAN address. In single-host rfsim, using `127.0.0.1` consistently is simplest.
  - Verify rfsim port (default 4043) alignment between DU (server) and UE (client).

- Suggested corrected snippets (embedded in `network_config` structure; comments explain changes):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNB_ID": "0x00000001", // Changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a valid small ID
      "amf_ip_address": "192.168.8.10", // Replace invalid abc.def.ghi.jkl with resolvable IP/DNS
      "f1_cu_ip": "127.0.0.1", // Ensure CU binds here
      "f1_du_ip": "127.0.0.1", // Ensure DU connects here for same-host rfsim
      "gtpu_local_addr": "192.168.8.43",
      "gtpu_port": 2152,
      "downlink_frequency": 3619200000,
      "uplink_frequency_offset": 0,
      "N_RB_DL": 106,
      "tdd_ul_dl_configuration_common": 7,
      "prach_config_index": 64
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "imsi": "208990000000001",
      "frequency": 3619200000,
      "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", // Match DU server address
      "rfsimulator_serverport": 4043
    }
  }
}
```

- Operational steps:
  - Apply config, start CU first; confirm NGAP connects to AMF (no DNS errors), then start DU; verify F1 Setup completes and DU prints radio activation and rfsim server listening; then start UE and observe TCP connect success and PRACH.
  - If NGAP Global gNB ID-related errors appear, adjust `gNB_ID` to match the 20–22 bit macro format expected by your deployment (e.g., `0x00000E00` if you want `3584`).

- Deep-dive validation (if needed):
  - Inspect NGAP PDU encodings for `GlobalRANNodeID` and `gNB-ID` bitstring length.
  - Check OAI `ngran_gNB_DU_id` and CU macro ID prints for consistency after the change.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and without timestamps, so exact sequencing is inferred.
- The provided `network_config` JSON is partial; some keys are inferred from logs and typical OAI configs.
- Immediate failure is AMF DNS; analysis emphasizes the provided misconfigured parameter as the root cause driver for identity issues that would block progress even after fixing DNS.
