## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- **Scenario**: OAI NR SA with `--rfsim` (software RF simulator). Components: CU, DU, UE.
- **Expected bring-up**: CU starts (config validated) → DU connects over F1-C (SCTP) to CU → DU activates radio/time source → rfsim server listens → UE connects to rfsim server → SSB sync → PRACH → RRC attach → (optionally) PDU session.
- **Misconfigured parameter given**: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.
  - In NR, the gNB ID used in NGAP/F1 is limited to at most 22 bits (3GPP TS 38.413/38.300). Valid max is `0x3FFFFF`. `0xFFFFFFFF` (32 bits) exceeds this and typically fails config sanity checks.
- **Immediate expectation**: CU performs strict config validation. An out-of-range `gNB_ID` forces config_execcheck to abort CU. If CU never listens on F1-C, the DU will retry SCTP with “connection refused”, and the UE will repeatedly fail to connect to the rfsim server because the DU never transitions to active radio state (it waits for F1 Setup Response from CU first).
- **Network config parsing (from provided JSON; values inferred from logs where not explicitly shown)**:
  - **gnb_conf (key items as observed in logs)**
    - `gNBs.gNB_ID`: misconfigured to `0xFFFFFFFF` (out-of-range).
    - `F1-C`: DU at `127.0.0.3` → CU `127.0.0.5`.
    - `PLMN`: CU log shows `mnc_length` invalid (`-1`) also flagged by config_execcheck (secondary issue, but root cause we focus on is gNB_ID). 
    - TDD config: consistent; absoluteFrequencySSB `641280` → `3619200000 Hz` (n78/n48 region in logs), `N_RB=106`, μ=1.
  - **ue_conf (key items as observed in logs)**
    - DL/UL frequency: `3619200000 Hz`, μ=1, `N_RB_DL=106`.
    - rfsimulator client attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` repeatedly → no server.


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU starts in SA mode with `--rfsim --sa` and reads config.
- Early config validation errors:
  - `config_check_intval: mnc_length: -1 invalid value` → config_execcheck flags PLMN list issue.
  - Then: `config_execcheck() Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun` → CU aborts before F1/NGAP setup.
- Notably, no lines indicating SCTP server bind for F1-C or NGAP towards AMF appear; the CU never reaches operational state.
- Cross-reference with misconfigured `gNB_ID`:
  - OAI checks `gNB_ID` range during config load; out-of-range values are fatal. Even if the log highlighted `mnc_length` first, the misconfigured `gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is sufficient to cause the CU to exit at config_execcheck. Thus, CU is down and not listening on F1-C.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU proceeds through PHY/MAC init successfully and prepares F1AP:
  - F1-C DU IP `127.0.0.3`, target CU `127.0.0.5`.
  - GTPU init, threads created, TDD configured, waiting gate: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`.
- Repeated failures:
  - `[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused` followed by F1AP retry notices → CU endpoint is not listening.
- Causal link: Because CU aborted during config_execcheck (rooted in invalid `gNB_ID`), the DU cannot complete F1 setup, hence it never activates radio nor starts/serves rfsim.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE initializes PHY at `3619200000 Hz`, μ=1, `N_RB_DL=106`.
- As rfsim client, it repeatedly attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`.
- All attempts fail with `errno(111)` (connection refused), indicating no server listening.
- Causal chain: DU is stuck waiting for F1 Setup (from CU). Without CU up, DU does not activate radio or rfsim server; hence UE cannot connect.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline correlation:
  - CU aborts during config validation (before F1/NGAP) → no F1-C listener.
  - DU retries SCTP to CU (connection refused), explicitly waits for F1 Setup Response before radio activation.
  - UE fails to connect to rfsim server (not started by DU due to above wait state).
- Guided by the misconfigured parameter `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`:
  - Specification/implementation constraint: NG-RAN `gNB_ID` is at most 22 bits; `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds limits. In OAI, `gNB_ID` is validated and on failure the softmodem exits.
  - While CU logs also show `mnc_length` invalid, the pre-known root cause we focus on is the invalid `gNB_ID`, which alone is sufficient to explain the CU exit, DU F1 connection refusals, and UE rfsim connection failures.
- Root cause: **Out-of-range `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` in CU (and likely DU) config violates 3GPP/OAI constraints, causing CU config_execcheck to abort.** This prevents the entire chain (F1 setup, DU activation, rfsim server availability, UE attach).


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Primary fix: Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within the allowed range (≤ 22 bits). Example: `0x000001` or any value ≤ `0x3FFFFF` that matches your planned Cell IDs topology.
- Secondary cleanups (recommended): Ensure PLMN fields (`mcc`, `mnc`, `mnc_length`) are valid and consistent in both CU and DU configs.
- After applying, verify:
  - CU reaches state where it binds F1-C/NGAP and logs do not show config_execcheck exits.
  - DU obtains F1 Setup Response, logs “activating radio” and starts rfsim server.
  - UE connects to rfsim server, detects SSB, proceeds with RACH and RRC setup.
- Suggested debug steps if issues persist:
  - Increase CU log verbosity for CONFIG/F1AP modules.
  - Confirm reachability between DU (127.0.0.3) and CU (127.0.0.5) loopback aliases.
  - Validate that DU’s `gNB_ID` does not collide improperly and that cellIdentity mapping is correct for your SIB1.

- Corrected config snippets (illustrative). Use the same value in both CU and DU where required by your deployment. JSON with inline comments (for explanation only):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000001",  // FIX: within 22-bit limit (<= 0x3FFFFF)
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom",
        "plmn_list": [
          { "mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2 }  // FIX: valid PLMN and length
        ],
        "F1AP": {
          "CU_IP": "127.0.0.5",  // unchanged
          "DU_IP": "127.0.0.3"   // unchanged
        },
        "servingcellconfigcommon": {
          "absoluteFrequencySSB": 641280,
          "downlink_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
          "subcarrierSpacing": 30,
          "N_RB": 106
        }
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "rfsimulator_serveraddr": "127.0.0.1",
        "rfsimulator_port": 4043
      },
      "phy": {
        "dl_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_frequency_hz": 3619200000,
        "subcarrierSpacing": 30,
        "N_RB_DL": 106
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- If you explicitly configure DU’s own `gNB_ID` or `gNB_DU_id`, ensure consistency and valid ranges too (e.g., `gNB_DU_id` often 16 bits per spec mapping; keep within OAI’s expected bounds).


## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and do not explicitly print the `gNB_ID` validation error line; however, the CU exits during config_execcheck and the misconfigured parameter is known a priori, which is sufficient to conclude root cause.
- PLMN invalidity is also present; while this alone could abort CU, the task specifies `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` as the misconfiguration to diagnose, which is independently fatal and explains the observed system behavior.
- Frequency/TDD details are consistent and do not indicate PHY issues; the failure occurs before radio activation due to control-plane bring-up blockage from the invalid `gNB_ID`.
