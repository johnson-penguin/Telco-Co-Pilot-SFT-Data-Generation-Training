## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions

We analyze an OAI 5G NR Standalone setup running with RF simulator based on the CU command line showing `--rfsim --sa`. Expected flow in this scenario:
- Component init (CU, DU, UE)
- F1-C setup between DU and CU; NGAP setup between CU and core (not shown here)
- UE synchronization and PRACH; RRC connection; PDU session establishment

The input highlights a misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. The `network_config` for `gnb_conf` and `ue_conf` is assumed to be extracted around typical OAI parameters; key item is `gNB_ID` under `gNBs`. In NR, the Global gNB ID comprises a PLMN and a gNB ID field; OAI typically constrains `gNB_ID` to be within 22 bits for NR gNB ID derivation. `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) exceeds 22 bits and is invalid for common OAI configurations, leading to config parsing/validation failure.

Initial scan of logs shows:
- CU: configuration parsing aborts with `libconfig` errors
- DU: initializes and then loops with SCTP connect retries to CU (F1AP)
- UE: repeatedly fails to connect to rfsim server (ECONNREFUSED), indicating the server side is not up


## 2. Analyzing CU Logs

Key CU log lines:
- `[LIBCONFIG] ... cu_case_118.conf - line 91: syntax error`
- `config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded`
- `init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed`
- `function config_libconfig_init returned -1`
- Commandline confirms `nr-softmodem --rfsim --sa -O cu_case_118.conf`

Interpretation:
- The CU fails at configuration parsing/validation. With `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` in the config, OAI’s configuration loader (based on libconfig) can flag out-of-range values or malformed tokens leading to syntax or semantic errors. The result is an aborted CU init, so no F1-C server, no NGAP, and crucially for rfsim, no RF simulator server side listening for the UE.

Cross-reference to `gnb_conf`:
- The `gNB_ID` must be a valid NR gNB identifier size. Common OAI deployments use up to 22 bits for gNB ID. `0xFFFFFFFF` violates this and can break parsing or later validation steps, matching the CU failure observed.


## 3. Analyzing DU Logs

Key DU log lines and stages:
- SA mode confirmation; PHY/MAC init successful
- Serving cell and TDD configuration parsed correctly (e.g., `absoluteFrequencySSB 641280` → 3619200000 Hz, `N_RB 106`, `mu 1`)
- Threads and GTP-U initialized
- F1AP start: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`
- Repeated SCTP connect failures: `Connect failed: Connection refused`, with F1AP retrying
- `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`

Interpretation:
- DU is healthy at PHY/MAC but cannot establish F1-C to the CU because the CU is not up (due to its config failure). The DU thus remains in a wait/retry loop, never activating the radio and never hosting a rfsim server endpoint that the UE can successfully reach through the CU.

Link to `gnb_conf`:
- DU’s inability to connect is a downstream effect of the CU failure caused by `gNB_ID` misconfiguration.


## 4. Analyzing UE Logs

Key UE lines:
- UE config shows consistent numerology and frequency with the DU (3619200000 Hz, `mu 1`, `N_RB 106`)
- Running as rfsim client, attempts to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`
- Repeated `connect() ... failed, errno(111)` indicating ECONNREFUSED

Interpretation:
- The rfsim server is not listening; in typical OAI rfsim SA setups, the server side is created by the gNB process. Because CU failed at configuration, the expected chain to bring up rfsim endpoints is broken, so the UE can’t connect.


## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis

Timeline correlation:
- CU aborts at config parse due to invalid `gNB_ID` → CU never starts
- DU keeps retrying F1-C SCTP connection to CU, refused (no listener)
- UE cannot connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 (no server)

Root cause centered on `misconfigured_param`:
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is invalid for OAI’s expected gNB ID field size (commonly 22-bit). This causes configuration parsing/validation failure in the CU (`libconfig` errors, init aborted). The failure cascades, preventing F1-C setup and rfsim server bring-up, which then causes DU connection retries and UE ECONNREFUSED.

External knowledge note:
- 3GPP defines a gNB ID with variable bit length (e.g., up to 32), but specific implementations constrain allowed ranges. OAI commonly uses a 22-bit gNB ID; values exceeding that (like `0xFFFFFFFF`) are rejected. This matches observed CU failure semantics.


## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis

Actionable fix:
- Set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid value within the supported bit-length (e.g., a small positive integer or a 22-bit-masked hex value). After correction, restart CU, then DU, then UE.

Suggested corrected snippets (within the existing `network_config` structure):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x00000001"  
        // Changed from 0xFFFFFFFF; choose a value within 22-bit range
      }
      // ... other gNB parameters unchanged
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      // Ensure UE rfsimulator server address/port matches gNB side (typically 127.0.0.1:4043)
      // No changes required if already correct
    }
  }
}
```

Verification steps after change:
- Start CU and confirm no `libconfig` errors; expect NGAP/F1 tasks to initialize
- Start DU; confirm F1 Setup Request/Response completes (no SCTP refusals)
- Start UE; confirm rfsim connects (no ECONNREFUSED), SSB detection, PRACH, RRC connection

Additional diagnostics if issues persist:
- Validate full config syntax around the edited line (no trailing commas, quotes, or formatting errors)
- Check OAI logs for explicit range validation messages for `gNB_ID`
- If using customized addressing, ensure F1-C IPs and rfsim endpoints align (e.g., `127.0.0.5` reachable)


## 7. Limitations

- CU logs show a generic syntax error without line contents; we infer the root cause guided by the provided `misconfigured_param` and typical OAI constraints on `gNB_ID`
- `network_config` JSON excerpt is partial; other config issues could exist but are not indicated by the logs
- Timings are not timestamped; we correlate based on typical component behavior and error patterns

Overall, correcting `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid range should allow the CU to start, enabling F1 setup for the DU and rfsim connectivity for the UE, resolving the observed cascade of failures.
