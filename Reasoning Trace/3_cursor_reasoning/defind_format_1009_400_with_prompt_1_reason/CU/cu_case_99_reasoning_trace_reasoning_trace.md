## 5G NR / OAI Reasoning Trace

## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
- The system runs OAI NR SA with `--rfsim --sa`. Expected bring-up: CU init → F1-C server ready → DU connects over F1-C → CU/AMF NGAP → radio activation → UE connects to rfsim server (port 4043) → PRACH/RRC → PDU session.
- CU logs stop early after config parsing; no F1-C listener observed. DU repeatedly retries SCTP to CU F1-C (`Connection refused`). UE retries TCP to rfsim server (`127.0.0.1:4043`, errno 111). This sequencing implies CU did not complete initialization; thus F1-C and rfsim server are not available for DU/UE.
- Misconfigured parameter: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`. In NGAP, `GlobalgNBID.gNB-ID` is a BIT STRING size 22..32 (3GPP TS 38.413/TS 38.300 family). OAI typically parses `gNB_ID` as an unsigned value and may combine it with NR Cell Identity. `0xFFFFFFFF` (4294967295) is the max 32-bit value and can overflow signed paths or be rejected by internal range checks or ASN.1 encoders. In practice, using `0xFFFFFFFF` is known to cause CU initialization/NG setup failures in OAI.
- Network config JSON not provided; infer defaults from logs: band n78, DL/UL 3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, TDD pattern present. No explicit `gnb_conf`/`ue_conf` fields are available to quote; the diagnosis is guided by the misconfigured `gNB_ID` and log behavior.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- CU confirms SA mode and loads config; it prints `F1AP: gNB_CU_id[0] 3584` and name. Then warning: `unknown ciphering algorithm "0"` (usually benign when `eea` not set). After that, only repeated `Reading 'GNBSParams' ...` entries—no messages like `Starting F1AP at CU`, no SCTP server bind for F1-C, no NGAP towards AMF.
- Cross-check: DU tries to connect to `F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`. Since CU is not listening, the DU receives `Connection refused`. This strongly indicates CU aborted or never reached F1AP server start, consistent with a fatal config issue during early NG/gNB identity setup.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU completes PHY/MAC init (TDD period, numerology µ=1, 106 PRBs). It starts F1AP and attempts SCTP client connect: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3 → CU 127.0.0.5`.
- The connect attempts fail with `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused`, followed by automatic retries. DU remains in `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio`, so radio/rfsim server for UE will not be active.
- Nothing in DU logs points to PRACH/SIB/PHY errors. The blocker is strictly F1-C connect refusal.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config aligns with DU PHY: 3619.2 MHz, 106 PRBs, TDD. UE acts as rfsim client and repeatedly tries to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043`, failing with errno 111 (connection refused).
- This matches the DU state: rfsim server is typically created by gNB side only after successful higher-layer bring-up. Since DU cannot complete F1 with CU, the UE cannot connect.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
- Timeline: CU stalls early → DU’s F1-C connect refused → UE’s rfsim connect refused. All are consistent with CU failing to start F1-C/NGAP due to a configuration error.
- Guided by the misconfigured parameter, `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is the trigger:
  - OAI enforces reasonable ranges for gNB-ID and may treat negative or out-of-range values as invalid after parsing. `0xFFFFFFFF` can become `-1` in signed contexts or be rejected by ASN.1 tools for NGAP GlobalgNBID composition.
  - When gNB-ID cannot be constructed/encoded, CU initialization of NG/F1 stack is aborted, preventing F1-C server and rfsim server from starting.
- Therefore, the root cause is an invalid `gNBs.gNB_ID` value that breaks CU initialization; DU/UE failures are downstream effects.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
- Fix: set `gNBs.gNB_ID` to a valid, bounded value within OAI-supported range (commonly a small decimal or hex within 22..32 bits, avoiding all-ones). Example: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0x000ABCDE` or simply `gNBs.gNB_ID=138`.
- After change, verify CU log shows F1AP server start and NGAP towards AMF; DU should receive F1 Setup Response; UE should connect to rfsim server and proceed to PRACH/RRC.
- If available, also ensure `gNBs.plmn`/`amf_ip_address` are correct; the earlier `unknown ciphering algorithm "0"` can be resolved by setting proper `eea`/`nea` if desired, but it is not the blocker here.
- Proposed corrected snippets (embedded as JSON-style for clarity; adapt to your `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` format):

```json
{
  "network_config": {
    "gnb_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0x000ABCDE", // changed from 0xFFFFFFFF to a valid bounded value
        "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
        "tac": 1,
        "plmn_list": [{ "mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2 }]
      },
      "F1AP": { "CU_f1c_ip": "127.0.0.5", "DU_f1c_ip": "127.0.0.3" }
    },
    "ue_conf": {
      "rf": {
        "dl_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "ul_freq_hz": 3619200000,
        "subcarrier_spacing": 30,
        "n_rb_dl": 106
      },
      "rfsimulator": { "server_addr": "127.0.0.1", "server_port": 4043 }
    }
  }
}
```

- Post-fix checks:
  - CU: look for `Starting F1AP at CU`, `NGAP SCTP association established`, `F1 Setup Request/Response`.
  - DU: F1 Setup succeeds, radio activation messages appear; rfsim server starts.
  - UE: TCP connect to 4043 succeeds; PRACH attempts shown; RRC procedures proceed.

## 7. Limitations
- The provided JSON lacks an explicit `network_config` object; values above are inferred from logs. Exact `gnb.conf`/`ue.conf` keys may differ from these JSON names.
- CU logs are truncated around config parsing, so the exact error print for `gNB_ID` isn’t shown; diagnosis is based on consistent cross-component symptoms and known OAI behavior with out-of-range gNB IDs.
- If uncertainty remains, consult 3GPP TS 38.413 for `GlobalgNBID` constraints and verify OAI’s config parsing/ASN.1 encoding paths for `gNB_ID`.
