## 1. Overall Context and Setup Assumptions
The logs indicate OAI 5G NR SA mode with RF simulator:
- CU/DU run in SA with `--rfsim --sa`.
- DU attempts F1-C SCTP to CU `127.0.0.5` and binds GTP-U on `127.0.0.3`.
- UE runs as RFSim client trying to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` but repeatedly fails (server side not up).

Expected flow in SA rfsim:
1) CU initializes, starts F1-C listener, and NGAP (AMF optional in this excerpt). 2) DU boots PHY/MAC, starts F1AP, completes F1 Setup with CU, then activates radio and launches rfsim server. 3) UE connects to rfsim, decodes SSB/SIB1, performs PRACH and RRC attach, PDU session, etc.

Provided misconfiguration: `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF`.

Network config (inferred key fields based on logs):
- gnb_conf: `gNB_ID` set to `0xFFFFFFFF` (invalid), F1 IPs CU `127.0.0.5`, DU `127.0.0.3`, TDD config present, DL freq ≈ 3619.2 MHz, N_RB 106 (100 MHz @ µ=1), security section includes `nia9` (unsupported).
- ue_conf: rfsimulator client to `127.0.0.1:4043`, DL freq 3619.2 MHz, µ=1, N_RB=106.

Early mismatches:
- CU log flags unknown integrity algorithm `nia9`.
- DU is stuck retrying SCTP to CU; UE cannot connect to rfsim server (errno 111) because DU never activates radio without F1 Setup success. The misconfigured `gNB_ID` plausibly blocks CU F1 listener and/or F1 Setup accept path.

Assumption: OAI validates `gNB_ID` bit-length per 3GPP constraints (NGAP/NR CellID composition). `0xFFFFFFFF` exceeds allowed width (commonly 22–32 bits with additional constraints; OAI examples use small values like 3584/0xE00). An invalid `gNB_ID` causes CU RRC/F1 identity setup to fail silently or skip starting F1 listener.

## 2. Analyzing CU Logs
- Version and SA mode confirmed. RAN context shows `RC.nb_nr_macrlc_inst = 0, RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0`, consistent with CU-only process.
- F1AP identifiers printed: `gNB_CU_id[0] 3584`, name `gNB-Eurecom-CU` (this is internal F1AP DU/CU IDs, not the overall `gNB_ID`).
- Error: `unknown integrity algorithm "nia9"` (config issue but not primary blocker here).
- Config parsing lines appear, but there is no subsequent line like “Starting F1AP at CU” or “Listening on SCTP …”. This suggests CU does not reach the F1-C listening state, consistent with a configuration error earlier in initialization (e.g., invalid `gNB_ID`).

Cross-reference with config:
- If `gNB_ID` is invalid, CU may fail to build/encode F1 Setup response capabilities or even avoid starting SCTP listener, leading to DU’s connection refused.
- CU log lacks SCTP/NGAP/F1 listener messages, supporting that the CU is not listening on F1-C.

## 3. Analyzing DU Logs
- DU initializes PHY/MAC fully: TDD period index, DL/UL slots, DL freq 3619200000 Hz (Band 48 per log text, though 3.6192 GHz aligns with n78 in many configs; the precise band label in the log is not material here), N_RB 106.
- DU starts F1AP and tries SCTP to CU: `F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3, connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5`.
- Repeated `SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused` and F1AP retries.
- Crucially: `waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio` appears; hence rfsim server is not started.

Link to `gNB_ID`:
- DU side boots fine; the failure is on the CU side to accept SCTP/F1, consistent with CU being misconfigured.

## 4. Analyzing UE Logs
- UE config matches DU PHY layer: DL 3619.2 MHz, µ=1, N_RB=106.
- UE runs as rfsim client and repeatedly fails to connect to `127.0.0.1:4043` with `errno(111)` (connection refused).
- This is expected because DU never activates radio/rfsim server while waiting for F1 Setup Response, which is blocked by CU not accepting SCTP/F1.

## 5. Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis
Timeline correlation:
- CU: configuration parsed, error about `nia9`, missing F1 listener start ⇒ likely initialization aborted/short-circuited.
- DU: Starts F1AP, attempts SCTP to CU, gets connection refused ⇒ CU not listening.
- UE: Cannot connect to rfsim server ⇒ DU never activated radio due to missing F1 Setup Response.

Root cause guided by misconfigured parameter:
- `gNBs.gNB_ID=0xFFFFFFFF` is out-of-range for OAI/3GPP usage. In NR, the `gNB ID` occupies a specific number of bits (commonly 22 bits within the 36-bit NCI where NCI = gNB_ID || CellID). OAI typically expects a sane, bounded integer (examples: decimal 3584 / hex 0x0E00). Using `0xFFFFFFFF` (32-bit all ones) violates expected constraints, leading to identity setup failure and preventing the CU from enabling F1-C listener/accept path.
- Secondary issue: `nia9` is unsupported (OAI supports `nia0`, `nia1`, `nia2`). While this should be corrected, the primary blocking symptom (CU not listening on F1-C) aligns with the invalid `gNB_ID`.

Therefore: The misconfigured `gNB_ID` at CU is the root cause, cascading to DU SCTP failures and UE rfsim connection failures.

## 6. Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis
Configuration fixes:
- Set a valid `gNBs.gNB_ID` consistent with OAI examples and within allowed range. Use `3584` (`0x0E00`), matching the IDs observed in logs for CU/DU (both print 3584 for F1AP internal ids). This ensures the CU constructs valid identities and enables F1 listener.
- Replace unsupported integrity algorithm with a supported one, e.g., `nia2`.

      }
    }
  }
}
```
- `gNB_ID`: set to `0x0E00` (decimal 3584). This aligns with OAI sample configurations and the IDs printed in logs, unblocking F1 listener/Setup.
- `integrity nia9` → `nia2` to avoid security config errors.

Validation steps after change:
- Start CU and verify logs show F1 listener start (e.g., SCTP bind/listen line) and no `unknown integrity algorithm` errors.
- Start DU; confirm F1 SCTP connects and “F1 Setup Response received,” followed by “activating radio” and rfsim server startup.
- Start UE; verify successful TCP connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, SSB detection, RRC connection setup, and PDU session establishment.

Further analysis options:
- If issues persist, enable higher verbosity for F1AP/RRC on CU, and confirm the NGAP/AMF configuration if end-to-end attach stalls beyond F1.
- Check that PLMN, TAC, and SIB1 parameters are consistent between CU/DU.

## 7. Limitations
- Logs are truncated and lack explicit CU F1 listener lines; the inference that CU didn’t start F1 is based on DU’s connection refused and missing CU F1 messages.
- Exact 3GPP bit-length for `gNB_ID` varies by configuration (22-bit typical for gNodeB ID within NCI); OAI enforces its own constraints. The remedy uses a known-good value from OAI samples (3584/0x0E00).
- Security algorithm mismatch (`nia9`) is orthogonal but was corrected to prevent additional initialization warnings.
